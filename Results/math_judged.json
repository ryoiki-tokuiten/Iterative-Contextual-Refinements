This strategy operates on the principle of transforming the integrand by introducing a specifically constructed multiplicative identity. The core insight is to hypothesize that the integrand, sec(x), is a component of a function whose form is f'(x)/f(x), which integrates to ln|f(x)|. The procedure involves: 1. Postulating the existence of a function g(x) such that multiplying sec(x) by g(x)/g(x) yields the desired logarithmic precursor form. 2. Analyzing the derivatives of functions related to sec(x), specifically sec(x) and tan(x), to identify a suitable candidate for f(x). The derivative of a linear combination, f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x), is examined. 3. Verifying that the derivative f'(x) is precisely sec(x) * f(x). This confirms the hypothesis that sec(x) can be rewritten as f'(x)/f(x). 4. Concluding that the integral can be solved by direct application of the integration rule for logarithmic derivatives, thereby bypassing more complex substitutions or transformations.",

This means any function f(x) of the form f(x) = A·sec(x) + A·tan(x) will satisfy the condition. To proceed, we need a non-trivial solution, so we can choose any non-zero value for A. The simplest choice is A = 1.\nLet A = 1.

The purpose of finding f(x) such that sec(x)·f(x) = f'(x) is to facilitate the integration. We can rewrite the integral by multiplying the integrand by 1 in the form of f(x)/f(x):\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ sec(x) · [f(x) / f(x)] dx\nSubstitute the derived f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x):\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ sec(x) · [ (sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ] dx\n\nDistribute sec(x) into the numerator:\nNumerator = sec(x) · (sec(x) + tan(x)) = sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)\nThe integral becomes:\n∫ [ (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ] dx\n\nWe now perform a u-substitution.\nLet u = sec(x) + tan(x).\nNow, we find the differential du by differentiating u with respect to x:\ndu/dx = d/dx [sec(x) + tan(x)]\ndu/dx = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)\nTherefore, du = (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx.\n\nBy comparing this to the integral, we see that the numerator, (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx, is exactly du, and the denominator, (sec(x) + tan(x)), is exactly u.\nSubstituting u and du into the integral:\n∫ (1/u) du\n\nThe integral of 1/u with respect to u is a standard result:\n∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + K\nwhere K is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for u in terms of x:\nu = sec(x) + tan(x)\nThe result of the integration is:\nln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + K\n\nThe final, definitive, and fully simplified answer has been derived by rigorously following the specified sub-strategy.\n\nFinal Answer: ∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + K"

            "solutionAttempt": "**Step 1: Assume the Solution Form and Differentiate**\n\nThe sub-strategy begins by assuming that the integral of sec(x) takes a specific logarithmic form. Let this assumption be:\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|f(x)| + C\nwhere f(x) is an unknown function to be determined, and C is the constant of integration.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, if F(x) = ∫g(x) dx, then F'(x) = g(x). Applying this to our assumption, we differentiate the expression ln|f(x)| + C with respect to x.\nThe derivative of the constant C is 0. We must find the derivative of ln|f(x)|. We use the chain rule and consider the two cases for the absolute value function.\n\nCase A: f(x) > 0\nIn this case, |f(x)| = f(x).\nd/dx [ln|f(x)|] = d/dx [ln(f(x))]\nUsing the chain rule, let u = f(x). Then d/dx [ln(u)] = (d/du [ln(u)]) * (du/dx).\n= (1/u) * f'(x)\n= (1/f(x)) * f'(x)\n= f'(x) / f(x)\n\nCase B: f(x) < 0\nIn this case, |f(x)| = -f(x).\nd/dx [ln|f(x)|] = d/dx [ln(-f(x))]\nUsing the chain rule, let v = -f(x). Then d/dx [ln(v)] = (d/dv [ln(v)]) * (dv/dx).\ndv/dx = d/dx [-f(x)] = -f'(x).\n= (1/v) * (-f'(x))\n= (1/(-f(x))) * (-f'(x))\n= (-f'(x)) / (-f(x))\n= f'(x) / f(x)\n\nIn both cases where f(x) is not zero, the derivative is the same. Therefore, we have rigorously established:\nd/dx [ln|f(x)| + C] = f'(x) / f(x)\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Differential Equation**\n\nFrom the initial assumption and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the derivative of the integral must equal the integrand.\nd/dx [∫sec(x) dx] = sec(x)\nWe have also shown that d/dx [ln|f(x)| + C] = f'(x)/f(x).\nBy equating these two expressions for the derivative, we establish the governing differential equation for the unknown function f(x):\nf'(x) / f(x) = sec(x)\n\n**Step 3: Rearrange the Differential Equation**\n\nThe sub-strategy requires rearranging this equation into the form of a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We perform the algebraic manipulation:\nf'(x) / f(x) = sec(x)\nAssuming f(x) is not identically zero (a necessary condition for ln|f(x)| to be defined), we multiply both sides by f(x):\nf'(x) = sec(x) * f(x)\nSubtracting the term sec(x) * f(x) from both sides yields the desired form:\nf'(x) - sec(x) * f(x) = 0\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Ordinary Differential Equation**\n\nThe sub-strategy instructs to solve this ODE by \"testing candidate solutions constructed from sec(x) and its derivatives\". We seek a non-trivial solution f(x) that satisfies f'(x) - sec(x) * f(x) = 0.\nThe derivative of sec(x) is sec(x)tan(x), and the derivative of tan(x) is sec²(x). This suggests that a solution might be a combination of sec(x) and tan(x). Let's test the candidate function:\nf(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)\n\nFirst, we must find the derivative of this candidate solution, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx [sec(x) + tan(x)]\n= d/dx [sec(x)] + d/dx [tan(x)]\nThe standard derivative rules are d/dx[sec(x)] = sec(x)tan(x) and d/dx[tan(x)] = sec²(x).\nf'(x) = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)\n\nNow, we substitute both f(x) and f'(x) into the left-hand side of the differential equation, f'(x) - sec(x) * f(x), and verify if it equals zero.\nSubstitution:\n[sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)] - sec(x) * [sec(x) + tan(x)]\nDistribute the sec(x) term:\n= sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x) - [sec(x) * sec(x) + sec(x) * tan(x)]\n= sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x) - [sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)]\nRemove the brackets, distributing the negative sign:\n= sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x) - sec²(x) - sec(x)tan(x)\nGroup like terms:\n= (sec²(x) - sec²(x)) + (sec(x)tan(x) - sec(x)tan(x))\n= 0 + 0\n= 0\n\nThe expression equals 0, which is the right-hand side of the ODE. Thus, f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x) is a valid, non-trivial solution to the differential equation.\nNote: Any constant multiple, k * f(x), would also be a solution. If we chose f(x) = k(sec(x) + tan(x)), the integral would be ln|k(sec(x)+tan(x))| + C = ln|k| + ln|sec(x)+tan(x)| + C. The term ln|k| is a constant that can be absorbed into the general constant of integration C. Therefore, we can proceed with the simplest solution where k=1.\n\n**Step 5: State the Final Solution**\n\nHaving successfully found the function f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x) that validates the governing differential equation, we substitute it back into our original assumption from Step 1:\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|f(x)| + C\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\nThis result was derived by rigorously and exclusively following the provided sub-strategy.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe definitive, fully simplified solution is:\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C"

We differentiate `u` with respect to `x`:\n`du/dx = d/dx(sin(x)) = cos(x)`\nMultiplying both sides by `dx`, we find the relationship between the differentials:\n`du = cos(x) dx`\nNow we can substitute `u` for `sin(x)` and `du` for `cos(x) dx` in the integral:\n`∫ (1 / (1 - sin^2(x))) * (cos(x) dx)`\n`= ∫ (1 / (1 - u^2)) du`\n\n**Step 5: Use partial fraction decomposition.**\nThe integrand is the rational function `1 / (1 - u^2)`. The denominator can be factored as a difference of squares: `1 - u^2 = (1 - u)(1 + u)`.\nWe seek to decompose the fraction into the form:\n`1 / ((1 - u)(1 + u)) = A/(1 - u) + B/(1 + u)`\nTo find the constants A and B, we multiply both sides by the denominator `(1 - u)(1 + u)`:\n`1 = A(1 + u) + B(1 - u)`\nWe can solve for A and B by substituting strategic values for u.\nTo solve for A, let `u = 1`:\n`1 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)`\n`1 = A(2) + B(0)`\n`1 = 2A`\n`A = 1/2`\nTo solve for B, let `u = -1`:\n`1 = A(1 + (-1)) + B(1 - (-1))`\n`1 = A(0) + B(2)`\n`1 = 2B`\n`B = 1/2`\nSubstituting these values back into the decomposition, we have:\n`1 / (1 - u^2) = (1/2)/(1 - u) + (1/2)/(1 + u)`\nThis can be written as:\n`1 / (1 - u^2) = (1/2) * [1/(1 - u) + 1/(1 + u)]`\nOur integral now becomes:\n`∫ (1/2) * [1/(1 - u) + 1/(1 + u)] du`\n\n**Step 6: Integrate each term.**\nUsing the linearity property of integrals, we can pull the constant factor out and split the integral into two parts:\n`= (1/2) * ∫ [1/(1 - u) + 1/(1 + u)] du`\n`= (1/2) * [∫ 1/(1 - u) du + ∫ 1/(1 + u) du]`\n\nLet's evaluate the first integral, `∫ 1/(1 - u) du`.\nLet `v = 1 - u`. Then `dv/du = -1`, so `dv = -du`, or `du = -dv`.\n`∫ 1/(1 - u) du = ∫ (1/v) (-dv) = -∫ (1/v) dv = -ln|v|`. Substituting back `v = 1 - u`, we get `-ln|1 - u|`.\n\nLet's evaluate the second integral, `∫ 1/(1 + u) du`.\nLet `w = 1 + u`. Then `dw/du = 1`, so `dw = du`.\n`∫ 1/(1 + u) du = ∫ (1/w) dw = ln|w|`. Substituting back `w = 1 + u`, we get `ln|1 + u|`.\n\nNow, we combine these results, including a single constant of integration, C:\n`= (1/2) * [-ln|1 - u| + ln|1 + u|] + C`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can combine the two logarithmic terms:\n`= (1/2) * ln| (1 + u) / (1 - u) | + C`\n\n**Step 7: Back-substitute and simplify.**\nWe now substitute `u = sin(x)` back into the expression:\n`= (1/2) * ln| (1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) | + C`\n\nThis is a correct result, but it can be simplified further to the standard canonical form. To achieve the final simplified answer, we manipulate the argument of the logarithm. We multiply the numerator and the denominator of the fraction inside the absolute value by `(1 + sin(x))`:\n`(1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) = [(1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x))] * [(1 + sin(x)) / (1 + sin(x))]`\n`= (1 + sin(x))^2 / (1 - sin^2(x))`\nUsing the Pythagorean identity `cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x)` for the denominator:\n`= (1 + sin(x))^2 / cos^2(x)`\n`= [(1 + sin(x)) / cos(x)]^2`\nWe can split the fraction inside the brackets:\n`= [1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x)]^2`\nUsing the definitions `sec(x) = 1/cos(x)` and `tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)`:\n`= [sec(x) + tan(x)]^2`\n\nNow substitute this simplified expression back into our solution:\n`= (1/2) * ln| (sec(x) + tan(x))^2 | + C`\nUsing the logarithm power rule `ln(a^p) = p * ln(a)`:\n`= (1/2) * 2 * ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n`= ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\nThis is the final, definitive, and fully simplified answer.\n\nFinal Answer:\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

            "solutionAttempt": "Here is the step-by-step execution of the sub-strategy to find the integral of sec(x).\n\n**Objective:** To calculate the integral I = ∫ sec(x) dx.\n\n**Sub-Strategy:** Derivation from Hyperbolic Analogy.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integral of the hyperbolic counterpart, sech(x).**\n\nThe hyperbolic secant function is defined as sech(x) = 1/cosh(x). We begin by evaluating its integral.\nLet I_h = ∫ sech(x) dx.\n\nTo transform the integrand into a more recognizable form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by cosh(x):\nI_h = ∫ (1/cosh(x)) * (cosh(x)/cosh(x)) dx\nI_h = ∫ cosh(x) / cosh²(x) dx\n\nWe now apply the fundamental hyperbolic identity, cosh²(x) - sinh²(x) = 1, which can be rearranged to cosh²(x) = 1 + sinh²(x). Substituting this into the denominator gives:\nI_h = ∫ cosh(x) / (1 + sinh²(x)) dx\n\nThis form suggests a substitution. Let u = sinh(x).\nTo find the differential du, we differentiate u with respect to x:\ndu/dx = d/dx(sinh(x)) = cosh(x)\nTherefore, du = cosh(x) dx.\n\nSubstituting u and du into the integral I_h:\nI_h = ∫ 1 / (1 + u²) du\n\nThis is a standard elementary integral. The antiderivative of 1/(1 + u²) is arctan(u).\nI_h = arctan(u) + C\n\nFinally, we substitute back u = sinh(x) to express the result in terms of x:\n∫ sech(x) dx = arctan(sinh(x)) + C\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key structural difference between trigonometric and hyperbolic identities.**\n\nThe successful integration of sech(x) relied on the identity cosh²(x) = 1 + sinh²(x).\nThe corresponding fundamental trigonometric identity is cos²(x) + sin²(x) = 1.\nThis can be rearranged to cos²(x) = 1 - sin²(x).\n\nLet us compare the two identities which form the basis for the integration techniques:\nHyperbolic: cosh²(x) = 1 + sinh²(x)\nTrigonometric: cos²(x) = 1 - sin²(x)\n\nThe crucial structural difference is the sign connecting the terms: a plus sign in the hyperbolic case and a minus sign in the trigonometric case. This difference, formalized by principles such as Osborne's Rule, is the root cause for the different integration outcomes. The `1 + u²` form in the hyperbolic case leads to an inverse tangent function, whereas a potential `1 - u²` form in the trigonometric case would lead to a logarithmic function via partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Step 3: Postulate the augmenting function for sec(x) based on the analogy.**\n\nThe direct analogical procedure for ∫ sec(x) dx would be:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ (1/cos(x)) dx = ∫ cos(x) / cos²(x) dx = ∫ cos(x) / (1 - sin²(x)) dx.\nA substitution `v = sin(x)`, `dv = cos(x) dx` would lead to ∫ 1 / (1 - v²) dv, which results in a logarithm.\n\nThe sub-strategy directs us to use the insight from this structural difference to find a suitable augmenting multiplier for sec(x). The goal is to find a function, let's call it g(x), such that when we multiply and divide the integrand sec(x) by g(x), the resulting expression takes the form ∫ f'(x)/f(x) dx, which integrates directly to ln|f(x)|.\n\nThe sub-strategy proposes that the structural analogy between the hyperbolic and trigonometric systems provides a logical justification for testing the specific function `f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)` as the denominator. This choice is not arbitrary but is a candidate inspired by the relationships between the derivatives of trigonometric functions. We will now systematically test this candidate.\n\n**Step 4: Systematically test the derivative of f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x) and solve the integral.**\n\nLet us define the function `f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`.\nOur goal is to see if the original integrand, sec(x), can be expressed in the form f'(x)/f(x).\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\nf'(x) = d/dx (sec(x) + tan(x))\n\nUsing the sum rule for differentiation:\nf'(x) = d/dx(sec(x)) + d/dx(tan(x))\n\nThe standard derivatives are:\nd/dx(sec(x)) = sec(x)tan(x)\nd/dx(tan(x)) = sec²(x)\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for f'(x):\nf'(x) = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)\n\nNow, let's examine the ratio f'(x)/f(x):\nf'(x)/f(x) = (sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x))\n\nWe can factor out sec(x) from the numerator:\nf'(x)/f(x) = (sec(x) * (tan(x) + sec(x))) / (sec(x) + tan(x))\n\nThe term (sec(x) + tan(x)) is common to both the numerator and the denominator, and since it is not identically zero, we can cancel it:\nf'(x)/f(x) = sec(x)\n\nThis rigorously demonstrates that `sec(x)` is precisely the logarithmic derivative of `f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`.\n\nNow we can solve the original integral, I = ∫ sec(x) dx.\nWe substitute `sec(x)` with `f'(x)/f(x)`:\nI = ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx\nwhere f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x) and f'(x) = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x).\n\nTo formally solve this integral, we perform a substitution. Let u = f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x).\nThen the differential du is:\ndu = f'(x) dx = (sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)) dx.\n\nThis substitution can be seen more clearly if we rewrite the original integral by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `sec(x) + tan(x)`:\nI = ∫ sec(x) * ( (sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ) dx\nI = ∫ (sec(x)(sec(x) + tan(x))) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) dx\nI = ∫ (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) dx\n\nNow, performing the substitution:\nLet u = sec(x) + tan(x).\nThen du = (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx.\n\nThe integral becomes:\nI = ∫ (1/u) du\n\nThis is the standard integral of 1/u, which is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of u.\nI = ln|u| + C\n\nSubstituting back u = sec(x) + tan(x):\nI = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\nThis derivation, executed by following the specified sub-strategy, has yielded a definitive answer. The final result is fully simplified.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C"

This strategy reframes the integration problem as a fundamental problem in differential geometry and cartography: the construction of a conformal (angle-preserving) map from a sphere to a cylinder. The integral emerges as a necessary consequence of the geometric constraints. The steps are: 1. Model the Earth as a sphere with the standard Riemannian metric expressed in latitude (φ) and longitude (λ) coordinates: ds² = R²(dφ² + cos²(φ)dλ²). 2. Define a projection onto a cylinder where the cylindrical coordinates are x = Rλ and y = y(φ). The metric on the cylinder is ds² = dx² + dy². 3. Impose the condition of conformality, which requires that the metric pulled back from the cylinder to the sphere is a scalar multiple of the original sphere metric. This means f*(g_cyl) = Ω²(φ) * g_sphere. 4. By expressing the pullback metric in terms of y'(φ) and comparing the coefficients of the dλ² and dφ² terms in the two metrics, derive two equations. 5. Solve the first equation for the scaling factor Ω(φ), which will be found to be sec(φ). 6. Substitute this scaling factor into the second equation, which yields a first-order ordinary differential equation for y(φ) of the form y'(φ) = R sec(φ). 7. The problem of finding the integral of secant is thus transformed into solving for the y-coordinate of the Mercator projection, with the integral being the solution to this geometrically derived differential equation.; Strategy 3: Universal Rationalization via Stereographic Projection. This strategy transforms the transcendental integrand into a purely algebraic one by re-parameterizing the trigonometric functions. It leverages the Weierstrass substitution (t = tan(x/2)), which is conceptually equivalent to a stereographic projection of the unit circle onto the real line. The pathway is: 1. Introduce the substitution t = tan(x/2). 2. Utilize fundamental trigonometric half-angle identities to derive expressions for sin(x), cos(x), and consequently sec(x), as rational functions of the variable t. 3. Derive the differential relationship between dx and dt by differentiating the substitution formula, resulting in an expression for dx as a rational function of t. 4. Substitute the rational expressions for both sec(x) and dx into the integral, thereby converting the entire trigonometric integral into an integral of a rational function in t. 5. Solve this new, purely algebraic integral using standard, systematic techniques for rational functions, namely the method of partial fraction decomposition. 6. Once the antiderivative is found in terms of t, perform the back-substitution t = tan(x/2) to express the final solution in terms of the original variable x.; Strategy 4: Infinite Series Representation and Term-wise Integration. This strategy shifts the problem from the domain of continuous calculus to that of discrete infinite series. The approach is to operate on the power series representation of the function rather than the function itself. The process is: 1. Derive the Maclaurin series for sec(x). This requires finding a general formula for the nth derivative of sec(x) at x=0, which involves the Euler numbers (E_n), leading to a power series of the form Σ a_n * x^(2n). 2. Apply the principle of term-by-term integration to this power series, which is valid within its radius of convergence. This involves applying the power rule for integration to each term, generating a new series of the form C + Σ [a_n / (2n+1)] * x^(2n+1). 3. The crucial and most complex step is to perform 'series recognition': identify the function that this newly generated power series represents. 4. This requires independently deriving the Maclaurin series for the candidate solution function, ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), by computing its successive derivatives and establishing a pattern. 5. The final step is to prove the identity of the two series by showing that the coefficients of the integrated secant series match the coefficients of the series for ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), thereby confirming the integral's solution through the machinery of infinite series.\n\nYour mission as 'Strategem Decomposer Maxima': Devise 4 **ENTIRELY NOVEL, UNIQUE, FULLY INDEPENDENT, and SELF-CONTAINED mini-plans (sub-strategies)**.

The specified sub-strategy will be followed with absolute rigor to determine the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Postulate the form of the augmenting function f(x)**\nAs per the sub-strategy, we postulate a general form for an augmenting function, f(x), as a linear combination of trigonometric functions associated with sec(x).\nLet f(x) = A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C, where A, B, and C are constants to be determined.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the derivative of f(x)**\nWe compute the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x).\nf'(x) = d/dx [A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C]\nUsing the rules of differentiation, we have:\nd/dx [A·sec(x)] = A · d/dx[sec(x)] = A·sec(x)tan(x)\nd/dx [B·tan(x)] = B · d/dx[tan(x)] = B·sec²(x)\nd/dx [C] = 0\nCombining these results, the derivative is:\nf'(x) = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\n\n**Step 3: Enforce the core condition**\nThe sub-strategy requires enforcing the condition that the augmented integrand, sec(x)·f(x), must be equal to the derivative, f'(x).\nsec(x)·f(x) = f'(x)\nSubstitute the expressions for f(x) and f'(x) into this identity:\nsec(x) · [A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C] = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\n\n**Step 4: Expand the identity and equate coefficients**\nFirst, expand the left side of the equation by distributing sec(x):\nsec(x)·(A·sec(x)) + sec(x)·(B·tan(x)) + sec(x)·(C) = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\nA·sec²(x) + B·sec(x)tan(x) + C·sec(x) = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\n\nTo solve for the coefficients A, B, and C, we rearrange the equation so that all terms are on one side, set equal to zero.\n[A·sec²(x) + B·sec(x)tan(x) + C·sec(x)] - [A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)] = 0\nGroup terms by the functions sec²(x), sec(x)tan(x), and sec(x):\n(A·sec²(x) - B·sec²(x)) + (B·sec(x)tan(x) - A·sec(x)tan(x)) + (C·sec(x)) = 0\nFactor out the common trigonometric functions:\n(A - B)sec²(x) + (B - A)sec(x)tan(x) + C·sec(x) = 0\n\nFor this equation to hold true for all values of x in the domain where the functions are defined, the coefficients of the linearly independent functions sec²(x), sec(x)tan(x), and sec(x) must all be zero. This yields a system of linear equations:\n1.  Coefficient of sec²(x): A - B = 0\n2.  Coefficient of sec(x)tan(x): B - A = 0\n3.  Coefficient of sec(x): C = 0\n\nWe now solve this system.\nFrom equation (3), we immediately find that C = 0.\nFrom equation (1), we have A = B.\nEquation (2), B - A = 0, also gives A = B, so it is consistent with but redundant to equation (1).\n\nThe solution to the system is C = 0 and A = B. This means any function f(x) of the form f(x) = A·sec(x) + A·tan(x) will satisfy the condition. To proceed, we need a non-trivial solution, so we can choose any non-zero value for A. The simplest choice is A = 1.\nLet A = 1. Then B = 1 and C = 0.\nSubstituting these coefficients back into the postulated form for f(x):\nf(x) = (1)·sec(x) + (1)·tan(x) + 0\nf(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)\n\nThis systematically determines the required augmenting function.\n\n**Step 5: Using the derived function f(x) to solve the integral**\nThe problem is to compute ∫ sec(x) dx. The purpose of finding f(x) such that sec(x)·f(x) = f'(x) is to facilitate the integration. We can rewrite the integral by multiplying the integrand by 1 in the form of f(x)/f(x):\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ sec(x) · [f(x) / f(x)] dx\nSubstitute the derived f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x):\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ sec(x) · [ (sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ] dx\n\nDistribute sec(x) into the numerator:\nNumerator = sec(x) · (sec(x) + tan(x)) = sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)\nThe integral becomes:\n∫ [ (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ] dx\n\nWe now perform a u-substitution.\nLet u = sec(x) + tan(x).\nNow, we find the differential du by differentiating u with respect to x:\ndu/dx = d/dx [sec(x) + tan(x)]\ndu/dx = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)\nTherefore, du = (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx.\n\nBy comparing this to the integral, we see that the numerator, (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx, is exactly du, and the denominator, (sec(x) + tan(x)), is exactly u.\nSubstituting u and du into the integral:\n∫ (1/u) du\n\nThe integral of 1/u with respect to u is a standard result:\n∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + K\nwhere K is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for u in terms of x:\nu = sec(x) + tan(x)\nThe result of the integration is:\nln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + K\n\nThe final, definitive, and fully simplified answer has been derived by rigorously following the specified sub-strategy.\n\nFinal Answer: ∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + K\n\n--- SOLUTION 2 (ID: main0-sub1) ---\n**Step 1: Assume the Solution Form and Differentiate**\n\nThe sub-strategy begins by assuming that the integral of sec(x) takes a specific logarithmic form. Let this assumption be:\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|f(x)| + C\nwhere f(x) is an unknown function to be determined, and C is the constant of integration.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, if F(x) = ∫g(x) dx, then F'(x) = g(x). Applying this to our assumption, we differentiate the expression ln|f(x)| + C with respect to x.\nThe derivative of the constant C is 0. We must find the derivative of ln|f(x)|. We use the chain rule and consider the two cases for the absolute value function.\n\nCase A: f(x) > 0\nIn this case, |f(x)| = f(x).\nd/dx [ln|f(x)|] = d/dx [ln(f(x))]\nUsing the chain rule, let u = f(x). Then d/dx [ln(u)] = (d/du [ln(u)]) * (du/dx).\n= (1/u) * f'(x)\n= (1/f(x)) * f'(x)\n= f'(x) / f(x)\n\nCase B: f(x) < 0\nIn this case, |f(x)| = -f(x).\nd/dx [ln|f(x)|] = d/dx [ln(-f(x))]\nUsing the chain rule, let v = -f(x). Then d/dx [ln(v)] = (d/dv [ln(v)]) * (dv/dx).\ndv/dx = d/dx [-f(x)] = -f'(x).\n= (1/v) * (-f'(x))\n= (1/(-f(x))) * (-f'(x))\n= (-f'(x)) / (-f(x))\n= f'(x) / f(x)\n\nIn both cases where f(x) is not zero, the derivative is the same. Therefore, we have rigorously established:\nd/dx [ln|f(x)| + C] = f'(x) / f(x)\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Differential Equation**\n\nFrom the initial assumption and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the derivative of the integral must equal the integrand.\nd/dx [∫sec(x) dx] = sec(x)\nWe have also shown that d/dx [ln|f(x)| + C] = f'(x)/f(x).\nBy equating these two expressions for the derivative, we establish the governing differential equation for the unknown function f(x):\nf'(x) / f(x) = sec(x)\n\n**Step 3: Rearrange the Differential Equation**\n\nThe sub-strategy requires rearranging this equation into the form of a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We perform the algebraic manipulation:\nf'(x) / f(x) = sec(x)\nAssuming f(x) is not identically zero (a necessary condition for ln|f(x)| to be defined), we multiply both sides by f(x):\nf'(x) = sec(x) * f(x)\nSubtracting the term sec(x) * f(x) from both sides yields the desired form:\nf'(x) - sec(x) * f(x) = 0\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Ordinary Differential Equation**\n\nThe sub-strategy instructs to solve this ODE by \"testing candidate solutions constructed from sec(x) and its derivatives\". We seek a non-trivial solution f(x) that satisfies f'(x) - sec(x) * f(x) = 0.\nThe derivative of sec(x) is sec(x)tan(x), and the derivative of tan(x) is sec²(x). This suggests that a solution might be a combination of sec(x) and tan(x). Let's test the candidate function:\nf(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)\n\nFirst, we must find the derivative of this candidate solution, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx [sec(x) + tan(x)]\n= d/dx [sec(x)] + d/dx [tan(x)]\nThe standard derivative rules are d/dx[sec(x)] = sec(x)tan(x) and d/dx[tan(x)] = sec²(x).\nf'(x) = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)\n\nNow, we substitute both f(x) and f'(x) into the left-hand side of the differential equation, f'(x) - sec(x) * f(x), and verify if it equals zero.\nSubstitution:\n[sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)] - sec(x) * [sec(x) + tan(x)]\nDistribute the sec(x) term:\n= sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x) - [sec(x) * sec(x) + sec(x) * tan(x)]\n= sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x) - [sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)]\nRemove the brackets, distributing the negative sign:\n= sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x) - sec²(x) - sec(x)tan(x)\nGroup like terms:\n= (sec²(x) - sec²(x)) + (sec(x)tan(x) - sec(x)tan(x))\n= 0 + 0\n= 0\n\nThe expression equals 0, which is the right-hand side of the ODE. Thus, f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x) is a valid, non-trivial solution to the differential equation.\nNote: Any constant multiple, k * f(x), would also be a solution. If we chose f(x) = k(sec(x) + tan(x)), the integral would be ln|k(sec(x)+tan(x))| + C = ln|k| + ln|sec(x)+tan(x)| + C. The term ln|k| is a constant that can be absorbed into the general constant of integration C. Therefore, we can proceed with the simplest solution where k=1.\n\n**Step 5: State the Final Solution**\n\nHaving successfully found the function f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x) that validates the governing differential equation, we substitute it back into our original assumption from Step 1:\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|f(x)| + C\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\nThis result was derived by rigorously and exclusively following the provided sub-strategy.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe definitive, fully simplified solution is:\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\n--- SOLUTION 3 (ID: main0-sub2) ---\nThe problem is to calculate the integral of sec(x), which is denoted as `∫ sec(x) dx`. I will follow the provided sub-strategy with absolute rigor.\n\n**Step 1: Rewrite sec(x) in terms of cos(x).**\nThe definition of the secant function is `sec(x) = 1/cos(x)`.\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ (1/cos(x)) dx`\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the numerator and denominator by cos(x).**\nThis is an algebraic manipulation where we multiply the integrand by `cos(x)/cos(x)`, which is equivalent to multiplying by 1.\n`∫ (1/cos(x)) * (cos(x)/cos(x)) dx`\n`= ∫ cos(x) / cos^2(x) dx`\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean identity to the denominator.**\nThe fundamental Pythagorean identity in trigonometry is `sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1`.\nRearranging this identity to solve for `cos^2(x)`, we get `cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x)`.\nWe substitute this expression into the denominator of our integrand:\n`∫ cos(x) / (1 - sin^2(x)) dx`\n\n**Step 4: Perform a u-substitution.**\nThe sub-strategy dictates the substitution `u = sin(x)`.\nTo perform the substitution, we must also find the differential `du`. We differentiate `u` with respect to `x`:\n`du/dx = d/dx(sin(x)) = cos(x)`\nMultiplying both sides by `dx`, we find the relationship between the differentials:\n`du = cos(x) dx`\nNow we can substitute `u` for `sin(x)` and `du` for `cos(x) dx` in the integral:\n`∫ (1 / (1 - sin^2(x))) * (cos(x) dx)`\n`= ∫ (1 / (1 - u^2)) du`\n\n**Step 5: Use partial fraction decomposition.**\nThe integrand is the rational function `1 / (1 - u^2)`. The denominator can be factored as a difference of squares: `1 - u^2 = (1 - u)(1 + u)`.\nWe seek to decompose the fraction into the form:\n`1 / ((1 - u)(1 + u)) = A/(1 - u) + B/(1 + u)`\nTo find the constants A and B, we multiply both sides by the denominator `(1 - u)(1 + u)`:\n`1 = A(1 + u) + B(1 - u)`\nWe can solve for A and B by substituting strategic values for u.\nTo solve for A, let `u = 1`:\n`1 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)`\n`1 = A(2) + B(0)`\n`1 = 2A`\n`A = 1/2`\nTo solve for B, let `u = -1`:\n`1 = A(1 + (-1)) + B(1 - (-1))`\n`1 = A(0) + B(2)`\n`1 = 2B`\n`B = 1/2`\nSubstituting these values back into the decomposition, we have:\n`1 / (1 - u^2) = (1/2)/(1 - u) + (1/2)/(1 + u)`\nThis can be written as:\n`1 / (1 - u^2) = (1/2) * [1/(1 - u) + 1/(1 + u)]`\nOur integral now becomes:\n`∫ (1/2) * [1/(1 - u) + 1/(1 + u)] du`\n\n**Step 6: Integrate each term.**\nUsing the linearity property of integrals, we can pull the constant factor out and split the integral into two parts:\n`= (1/2) * ∫ [1/(1 - u) + 1/(1 + u)] du`\n`= (1/2) * [∫ 1/(1 - u) du + ∫ 1/(1 + u) du]`\n\nLet's evaluate the first integral, `∫ 1/(1 - u) du`.\nLet `v = 1 - u`. Then `dv/du = -1`, so `dv = -du`, or `du = -dv`.\n`∫ 1/(1 - u) du = ∫ (1/v) (-dv) = -∫ (1/v) dv = -ln|v|`. Substituting back `v = 1 - u`, we get `-ln|1 - u|`.\n\nLet's evaluate the second integral, `∫ 1/(1 + u) du`.\nLet `w = 1 + u`. Then `dw/du = 1`, so `dw = du`.\n`∫ 1/(1 + u) du = ∫ (1/w) dw = ln|w|`. Substituting back `w = 1 + u`, we get `ln|1 + u|`.\n\nNow, we combine these results, including a single constant of integration, C:\n`= (1/2) * [-ln|1 - u| + ln|1 + u|] + C`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can combine the two logarithmic terms:\n`= (1/2) * ln| (1 + u) / (1 - u) | + C`\n\n**Step 7: Back-substitute and simplify.**\nWe now substitute `u = sin(x)` back into the expression:\n`= (1/2) * ln| (1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) | + C`\n\nThis is a correct result, but it can be simplified further to the standard canonical form. To achieve the final simplified answer, we manipulate the argument of the logarithm. We multiply the numerator and the denominator of the fraction inside the absolute value by `(1 + sin(x))`:\n`(1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) = [(1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x))] * [(1 + sin(x)) / (1 + sin(x))]`\n`= (1 + sin(x))^2 / (1 - sin^2(x))`\nUsing the Pythagorean identity `cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x)` for the denominator:\n`= (1 + sin(x))^2 / cos^2(x)`\n`= [(1 + sin(x)) / cos(x)]^2`\nWe can split the fraction inside the brackets:\n`= [1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x)]^2`\nUsing the definitions `sec(x) = 1/cos(x)` and `tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)`:\n`= [sec(x) + tan(x)]^2`\n\nNow substitute this simplified expression back into our solution:\n`= (1/2) * ln| (sec(x) + tan(x))^2 | + C`\nUsing the logarithm power rule `ln(a^p) = p * ln(a)`:\n`= (1/2) * 2 * ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n`= ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\nThis is the final, definitive, and fully simplified answer.\n\nFinal Answer:\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\n--- SOLUTION 4 (ID: main0-sub3) ---\nHere is the step-by-step execution of the sub-strategy to find the integral of sec(x).\n\n**Objective:** To calculate the integral I = ∫ sec(x) dx.\n\n**Sub-Strategy:** Derivation from Hyperbolic Analogy.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integral of the hyperbolic counterpart, sech(x).**\n\nThe hyperbolic secant function is defined as sech(x) = 1/cosh(x). We begin by evaluating its integral.\nLet I_h = ∫ sech(x) dx.\n\nTo transform the integrand into a more recognizable form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by cosh(x):\nI_h = ∫ (1/cosh(x)) * (cosh(x)/cosh(x)) dx\nI_h = ∫ cosh(x) / cosh²(x) dx\n\nWe now apply the fundamental hyperbolic identity, cosh²(x) - sinh²(x) = 1, which can be rearranged to cosh²(x) = 1 + sinh²(x). Substituting this into the denominator gives:\nI_h = ∫ cosh(x) / (1 + sinh²(x)) dx\n\nThis form suggests a substitution. Let u = sinh(x).\nTo find the differential du, we differentiate u with respect to x:\ndu/dx = d/dx(sinh(x)) = cosh(x)\nTherefore, du = cosh(x) dx.\n\nSubstituting u and du into the integral I_h:\nI_h = ∫ 1 / (1 + u²) du\n\nThis is a standard elementary integral. The antiderivative of 1/(1 + u²) is arctan(u).\nI_h = arctan(u) + C\n\nFinally, we substitute back u = sinh(x) to express the result in terms of x:\n∫ sech(x) dx = arctan(sinh(x)) + C\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key structural difference between trigonometric and hyperbolic identities.**\n\nThe successful integration of sech(x) relied on the identity cosh²(x) = 1 + sinh²(x).\nThe corresponding fundamental trigonometric identity is cos²(x) + sin²(x) = 1.\nThis can be rearranged to cos²(x) = 1 - sin²(x).\n\nLet us compare the two identities which form the basis for the integration techniques:\nHyperbolic: cosh²(x) = 1 + sinh²(x)\nTrigonometric: cos²(x) = 1 - sin²(x)\n\nThe crucial structural difference is the sign connecting the terms: a plus sign in the hyperbolic case and a minus sign in the trigonometric case. This difference, formalized by principles such as Osborne's Rule, is the root cause for the different integration outcomes. The `1 + u²` form in the hyperbolic case leads to an inverse tangent function, whereas a potential `1 - u²` form in the trigonometric case would lead to a logarithmic function via partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Step 3: Postulate the augmenting function for sec(x) based on the analogy.**\n\nThe direct analogical procedure for ∫ sec(x) dx would be:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ (1/cos(x)) dx = ∫ cos(x) / cos²(x) dx = ∫ cos(x) / (1 - sin²(x)) dx.\nA substitution `v = sin(x)`, `dv = cos(x) dx` would lead to ∫ 1 / (1 - v²) dv, which results in a logarithm.\n\nThe sub-strategy directs us to use the insight from this structural difference to find a suitable augmenting multiplier for sec(x). The goal is to find a function, let's call it g(x), such that when we multiply and divide the integrand sec(x) by g(x), the resulting expression takes the form ∫ f'(x)/f(x) dx, which integrates directly to ln|f(x)|.\n\nThe sub-strategy proposes that the structural analogy between the hyperbolic and trigonometric systems provides a logical justification for testing the specific function `f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)` as the denominator. This choice is not arbitrary but is a candidate inspired by the relationships between the derivatives of trigonometric functions. We will now systematically test this candidate.\n\n**Step 4: Systematically test the derivative of f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x) and solve the integral.**\n\nLet us define the function `f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`.\nOur goal is to see if the original integrand, sec(x), can be expressed in the form f'(x)/f(x).\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\nf'(x) = d/dx (sec(x) + tan(x))\n\nUsing the sum rule for differentiation:\nf'(x) = d/dx(sec(x)) + d/dx(tan(x))\n\nThe standard derivatives are:\nd/dx(sec(x)) = sec(x)tan(x)\nd/dx(tan(x)) = sec²(x)\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for f'(x):\nf'(x) = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)\n\nNow, let's examine the ratio f'(x)/f(x):\nf'(x)/f(x) = (sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x))\n\nWe can factor out sec(x) from the numerator:\nf'(x)/f(x) = (sec(x) * (tan(x) + sec(x))) / (sec(x) + tan(x))\n\nThe term (sec(x) + tan(x)) is common to both the numerator and the denominator, and since it is not identically zero, we can cancel it:\nf'(x)/f(x) = sec(x)\n\nThis rigorously demonstrates that `sec(x)` is precisely the logarithmic derivative of `f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`.\n\nNow we can solve the original integral, I = ∫ sec(x) dx.\nWe substitute `sec(x)` with `f'(x)/f(x)`:\nI = ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx\nwhere f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x) and f'(x) = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x).\n\nTo formally solve this integral, we perform a substitution. Let u = f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x).\nThen the differential du is:\ndu = f'(x) dx = (sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)) dx.\n\nThis substitution can be seen more clearly if we rewrite the original integral by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `sec(x) + tan(x)`:\nI = ∫ sec(x) * ( (sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ) dx\nI = ∫ (sec(x)(sec(x) + tan(x))) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) dx\nI = ∫ (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) dx\n\nNow, performing the substitution:\nLet u = sec(x) + tan(x).\nThen du = (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx.\n\nThe integral becomes:\nI = ∫ (1/u) du\n\nThis is the standard integral of 1/u, which is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of u.\nI = ln|u| + C\n\nSubstituting back u = sec(x) + tan(x):\nI = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\nThis derivation, executed by following the specified sub-strategy, has yielded a definitive answer. The final result is fully simplified.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C",

        "judgedBestSolution": "### Judged Best Solution for Strategy 1\n\n**Origin:** from Sub-Strategy originating from \"Sub-strategy 1: Systematic Coefficient Determinati...\"\n\n**Reasoning for Selection:**\nThe selected solution, ID main0-sub0, is superior to the others in its rigorous adherence to the specified strategy, its pedagogical clarity, and its mathematical elegance.\n\n1.  **Superior Adherence to Strategy:** The core of the 'Algebraic Augmentation' strategy is to find a function `f(x)` such that `sec(x)` can be written as `f'(x)/f(x)`. Solution 1 is the only one that *constructs* this function from first principles. By postulating a general form `f(x) = A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C` and enforcing the condition `f'(x) = sec(x)·f(x)`, it systematically and unequivocally derives that `f(x)` must be a multiple of `sec(x) + tan(x)`. This approach eliminates any need for a 'magic guess' and perfectly embodies the spirit of the strategy.\n\n2.  **Rigor and Elegance:** This constructive approach is more rigorous and elegant than the alternatives. \n    *   Solution 2 recasts the problem as a differential equation and then *verifies* that `f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)` is a solution. While correct, this verifies a candidate rather than deriving it from scratch, which is a less fundamental approach.\n    *   Solution 4 uses a lengthy, distracting analogy with hyperbolic functions to *motivate* the choice of `sec(x) + tan(x)`. The core argument is still based on verifying a guess, and the preamble makes the solution less direct and focused.\n\n3.  **Clarity and Insight:** By showing *why* `sec(x) + tan(x)` is the correct function, Solution 1 provides the deepest insight. It demystifies the common 'trick' of multiplying by `(sec(x) + tan(x))/(sec(x) + tan(x))` by revealing its algebraic origin. The step-by-step process of equating coefficients of linearly independent functions is exceptionally clear and methodical.\n\n4.  **Exclusion of Invalid Solutions:** Solution 3 is demonstrably incorrect in the context of the evaluation, as it uses a completely different method (u-substitution leading to partial fractions). It fails the primary criterion of adhering to the specified strategy.\n\nIn conclusion, Solution 1 provides the most complete and satisfying proof according to the defined strategy. It is not merely a solution, but an exposition of the underlying mathematical structure that makes the solution possible.\n\n---\n\n**Final Solution Text:**\nThe problem is to find the integral of sec(x), denoted as ∫ sec(x) dx. The specified strategy will be followed with absolute rigor to determine the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Postulate the form of the augmenting function f(x)**\nAs per the strategy, we hypothesize that the integrand can be expressed in the form f'(x)/f(x). We postulate a general form for the denominator, f(x), as a linear combination of trigonometric functions associated with sec(x).\nLet f(x) = A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C, where A, B, and C are constants to be determined.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the derivative of f(x)**\nWe compute the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x).\nf'(x) = d/dx [A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C]\nUsing the rules of differentiation, we have:\nd/dx [A·sec(x)] = A·sec(x)tan(x)\nd/dx [B·tan(x)] = B·sec²(x)\nd/dx [C] = 0\nCombining these results, the derivative is:\nf'(x) = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\n\n**Step 3: Enforce the core condition**\nThe strategy requires that sec(x) = f'(x)/f(x), which is equivalent to f'(x) = sec(x)·f(x). We enforce this condition to find the constants A, B, and C.\nsec(x) · [A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C] = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\n\n**Step 4: Expand the identity and equate coefficients**\nFirst, expand the left side of the equation by distributing sec(x):\nA·sec²(x) + B·sec(x)tan(x) + C·sec(x) = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\n\nTo solve for the coefficients, we rearrange the equation to be equal to zero.\n(A - B)sec²(x) + (B - A)sec(x)tan(x) + C·sec(x) = 0\n\nFor this equation to hold true for all values of x, the coefficients of the linearly independent functions must all be zero. This yields a system of linear equations:\n1. Coefficient of sec²(x): A - B = 0  => A = B\n2. Coefficient of sec(x)tan(x): B - A = 0 => B = A\n3. Coefficient of sec(x): C = 0\n\nThe solution to the system is C = 0 and A = B. We need a non-trivial solution, so we can choose any non-zero value for A. The simplest choice is A = 1, which implies B = 1.\nSubstituting these coefficients back into the postulated form for f(x):\nf(x) = (1)·sec(x) + (1)·tan(x) + 0\nf(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)\nThis process systematically determines the required augmenting function.\n\n**Step 5: Using the derived function f(x) to solve the integral**\nWe have established that for f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x), the relationship sec(x) = f'(x)/f(x) holds. We can now solve the integral:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [f'(x) / f(x)] dx\n\nTo see this more explicitly, we multiply the integrand by 1 in the form of f(x)/f(x):\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ sec(x) · [ (sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ] dx\n\nDistribute sec(x) into the numerator:\n∫ [ (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ] dx\n\nWe perform a u-substitution.\nLet u = sec(x) + tan(x).\nNow, we find the differential du by differentiating u with respect to x:\ndu/dx = d/dx [sec(x) + tan(x)] = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)\nTherefore, du = (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx.\n\nBy comparing this to the integral, we see that the numerator is exactly du and the denominator is exactly u.\nSubstituting u and du into the integral:\n∫ (1/u) du\n\nThe integral of 1/u is a standard result:\n∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + C\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for u in terms of x:\nThe result of the integration is:\nln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\n**Final Answer:** ∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C"

This strategy reframes the integration problem as a fundamental problem in differential geometry and cartography: the construction of a conformal (angle-preserving) map from a sphere to a cylinder. The integral emerges as a necessary consequence of the geometric constraints. The steps are: 1. Model the Earth as a sphere with the standard Riemannian metric expressed in latitude (φ) and longitude (λ) coordinates: ds² = R²(dφ² + cos²(φ)dλ²). 2. Define a projection onto a cylinder where the cylindrical coordinates are x = Rλ and y = y(φ). The metric on the cylinder is ds² = dx² + dy². 3. Impose the condition of conformality, which requires that the metric pulled back from the cylinder to the sphere is a scalar multiple of the original sphere metric. This means f*(g_cyl) = Ω²(φ) * g_sphere. 4. By expressing the pullback metric in terms of y'(φ) and comparing the coefficients of the dλ² and dφ² terms in the two metrics, derive two equations. 5. Solve the first equation for the scaling factor Ω(φ), which will be found to be sec(φ). 6. Substitute this scaling factor into the second equation, which yields a first-order ordinary differential equation for y(φ) of the form y'(φ) = R sec(φ). 7. The problem of finding the integral of secant is thus transformed into solving for the y-coordinate of the Mercator projection, with the integral being the solution to this geometrically derived differential equation.",

            "solutionAttempt": "Herein is the rigorous derivation of the integral of sec(x) by exclusive adherence to the specified sub-strategy.\n\n### **Preamble: Conforming to the Sub-Strategy**\n\nThe provided sub-strategy dictates a derivation from the first principles of conformality. The goal is to find the function `y(φ)` for the Mercator projection `F(φ, λ) = (Rλ, y(φ))`, where `φ` is latitude and `λ` is longitude on a sphere of radius `R`. This will lead to a differential equation for `y'(φ)`, the solution of which requires finding the integral of the secant function.\n\n### **Step 1: Definition of Tangent Vectors on the Sphere**\n\nLet the sphere S² of radius `R` be parameterized by latitude `φ` and longitude `λ`. The tangent space `T_P(S²) ` at any point `P = (φ, λ)` is a two-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis vectors `∂/∂φ` and `∂/∂λ`.\n\nAn arbitrary tangent vector `v` in this space can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors:\n`v = a(∂/∂φ) + b(∂/∂λ)`\nwhere `a` and `b` are scalar components.\n\nAs per the sub-strategy, we define two arbitrary tangent vectors, `v1` and `v2`, at the point `(φ, λ)`:\n`v1 = a1(∂/∂φ) + b1(∂/∂λ)`\n`v2 = a2(∂/∂φ) + b2(∂/∂λ)`\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation of the Angle on the Sphere**\n\nTo calculate the angle `θ_sphere` between `v1` and `v2`, we first require the metric tensor `g_sphere` of the sphere. The standard parameterization of the sphere in Euclidean coordinates `(x, y, z)` is:\n`r(φ, λ) = (R cos(φ) cos(λ), R cos(φ) sin(λ), R sin(φ))`\n\nThe basis tangent vectors are the partial derivatives of `r`:\n`r_φ = ∂r/∂φ = (-R sin(φ) cos(λ), -R sin(φ) sin(λ), R cos(φ))`\n`r_λ = ∂r/∂λ = (-R cos(φ) sin(λ), R cos(φ) cos(λ), 0)`\n\nThe components of the metric tensor `g_ij` are the dot products of these basis vectors:\n`g_φφ = r_φ · r_φ = (-R sinφ cosλ)² + (-R sinφ sinλ)² + (R cosφ)² = R²sin²φ(cos²λ + sin²λ) + R²cos²φ = R²(sin²φ + cos²φ) = R²`\n`g_λλ = r_λ · r_λ = (-R cosφ sinλ)² + (R cosφ cosλ)² + 0² = R²cos²φ(sin²λ + cos²λ) = R²cos²φ`\n`g_φλ = g_λφ = r_φ · r_λ = R²sinφcosφcosλsinλ - R²sinφcosφsinλcosλ = 0`\n\nThus, the spherical metric tensor in the `(φ, λ)` coordinate system is:\n`g_sphere = [ g_φφ  g_φλ ] = [ R²      0     ]`\n`          [ g_λφ  g_λλ ]   [ 0    R²cos²φ ]`\n\nThe inner product of `v1` and `v2` is `g_sphere(v1, v2)`. Using the component representation `v1 = (a1, b1)` and `v2 = (a2, b2)`:\n`g_sphere(v1, v2) = [a1, b1] [ R²      0     ] [a2] = a1a2R² + b1b2R²cos²φ`\n`                           [ 0    R²cos²φ ] [b2]`\n\nThe squared magnitudes of the vectors are:\n`||v1||_sphere² = g_sphere(v1, v1) = a1²R² + b1²R²cos²φ`\n`||v2||_sphere² = g_sphere(v2, v2) = a2²R² + b2²R²cos²φ`\n\nThe cosine of the angle `θ_sphere` between `v1` and `v2` is given by the formula:\n`cos(θ_sphere) = g_sphere(v1, v2) / (||v1||_sphere * ||v2||_sphere)`\n`cos(θ_sphere) = (a1a2R² + b1b2R²cos²φ) / sqrt((a1²R² + b1²R²cos²φ) * (a2²R² + b2²R²cos²φ))`\n\n### **Step 3: Pushforward to the Cylindrical Map**\n\nThe Mercator projection is a map `F` from the sphere's coordinates `(φ, λ)` to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)` on a plane (representing the unrolled cylinder). The map is defined as:\n`F(φ, λ) = (x(φ, λ), y(φ, λ)) = (Rλ, y(φ))`\nwhere `y(φ)` is the function we seek to determine.\n\nThe pushforward map `F_*` transforms tangent vectors from the sphere to the plane. It is represented by the Jacobian matrix of `F`:\n`F_* = J(F) = [ ∂x/∂φ  ∂x/∂λ ] = [ 0      R   ]`\n`             [ ∂y/∂φ  ∂y/∂λ ]   [ y'(φ)  0   ]`\nwhere `y'(φ) = dy/dφ`.\n\nWe apply `F_*` to the components of `v1` and `v2` to find their images, `w1` and `w2`, in the tangent space of the plane:\n`w1 = F_*(v1) = [ 0  R ] [a1] = [ Rb1   ]`. In the basis `(∂/∂x, ∂/∂y)`, this is `w1 = Rb1(∂/∂x) + a1y'(φ)(∂/∂y)`.\n`                  [ y' 0 ] [b1]   [ a1y' ]`\n`w2 = F_*(v2) = [ 0  R ] [a2] = [ Rb2   ]`. In the basis `(∂/∂x, ∂/∂y)`, this is `w2 = Rb2(∂/∂x) + a2y'(φ)(∂/∂y)`.\n`                  [ y' 0 ] [b2]   [ a2y' ]`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculation of the Angle on the Map**\n\nThe angle `θ_map` between `w1` and `w2` is calculated using the standard Euclidean metric on the plane, which is the identity matrix `g_Euc = I`. The inner product is the standard dot product.\nThe component representations of the mapped vectors are `w1 = (Rb1, a1y'(φ))` and `w2 = (Rb2, a2y'(φ))`.\n\nThe Euclidean inner product is:\n`g_Euc(w1, w2) = w1 · w2 = (Rb1)(Rb2) + (a1y'(φ))(a2y'(φ)) = R²b1b2 + (y'(φ))²a1a2`\n\nThe squared magnitudes are:\n`||w1||_map² = g_Euc(w1, w1) = (Rb1)² + (a1y'(φ))² = R²b1² + (y'(φ))²a1²`\n`||w2||_map² = g_Euc(w2, w2) = (Rb2)² + (a2y'(φ))² = R²b2² + (y'(φ))²a2²`\n\nThe cosine of the angle `θ_map` is:\n`cos(θ_map) = g_Euc(w1, w2) / (||w1||_map * ||w2||_map)`\n`cos(θ_map) = ((y'(φ))²a1a2 + R²b1b2) / sqrt(((y'(φ))²a1² + R²b1²) * ((y'(φ))²a2² + R²b2²))`\n\n### **Step 5: Imposition of the Conformality Axiom**\n\nA map is conformal if it preserves angles. Therefore, we must impose the condition `θ_sphere = θ_map` for any choice of vectors `v1` and `v2`. This is equivalent to equating their cosines:\n`cos(θ_sphere) = cos(θ_map)`\n\n`(a1a2R² + b1b2R²cos²φ) / sqrt((a1²R² + b1²R²cos²φ)(a2²R² + b2²R²cos²φ)) = ((y'(φ))²a1a2 + R²b1b2) / sqrt(((y'(φ))²a1² + R²b1²)((y'(φ))²a2² + R²b2²))`\n\n### **Step 6: Derivation of the Differential Equation**\n\nThe equality from Step 5 must hold for all possible values of `a1, b1, a2, b2`. This is a powerful constraint. An expression of the form `(Aa1a2 + Bb1b2) / sqrt((Aa1² + Bb1²)(Aa2² + Bb2²))` is determined solely by the ratio `A/B`. For the two cosine expressions to be equal for all vectors, the structure of their dependence on the vector components must be identical. This implies that the ratio of the coefficients of the `a_i a_j` terms to the `b_i b_j` terms must be the same in both expressions.\n\nLet's compare the coefficients:\nFrom `cos(θ_sphere)`, the coefficient of `a1a2` terms is `R²`, and the coefficient of `b1b2` terms is `R²cos²φ`.\nThe ratio is `(R²) / (R²cos²φ) = sec²φ`.\n\nFrom `cos(θ_map)`, the coefficient of `a1a2` terms is `(y'(φ))²`, and the coefficient of `b1b2` terms is `R²`.\nThe ratio is `(y'(φ))² / R²`.\n\nFor the angle formulas to be identical, these ratios must be equal:\n`(y'(φ))² / R² = sec²φ`\n\nMultiplying by `R²` gives the relationship:\n`(y'(φ))² = R²sec²φ`\n\nTaking the square root of both sides yields:\n`y'(φ) = ± R sec(φ)`\n\nBy convention, the map is defined such that y increases with increasing latitude φ (for φ in (-π/2, π/2)), so we choose the positive root:\n`y'(φ) = R sec(φ)`\n\nThis is the fundamental differential equation for the Mercator projection, derived directly from the axiom of conformality as required by the sub-strategy.\n\n### **Step 7: Solution of the Integral**\n\nThe original problem is to find the integral of `sec(x)`. Our derivation has shown that the Mercator coordinate `y(φ)` is the integral of `R sec(φ)`.\n`y(φ) = ∫ R sec(φ) dφ = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\nTo solve `∫ sec(φ) dφ`, we use the standard technique of multiplying the integrand by `1` in the form of `(sec(φ) + tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ))`:\n`∫ sec(φ) dφ = ∫ sec(φ) * (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) dφ`\n`= ∫ (sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) dφ`\n\nWe perform a u-substitution. Let:\n`u = sec(φ) + tan(φ)`\n\nNow, we find the differential `du`:\n`du/dφ = d/dφ(sec(φ)) + d/dφ(tan(φ))`\nThe derivatives are `d/dφ(sec(φ)) = sec(φ)tan(φ)` and `d/dφ(tan(φ)) = sec²(φ)`.\nSo, `du/dφ = sec(φ)tan(φ) + sec²(φ)`.\nThis gives `du = (sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ)) dφ`.\n\nSubstituting `u` and `du` into the integral, we find that the numerator is exactly `du` and the denominator is `u`:\n`∫ (1/u) du`\n\nThe integral of `1/u` is `ln|u| + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration.\nSubstituting back for `u`, we obtain the result:\n`∫ sec(φ) dφ = ln|sec(φ) + tan(φ)| + C`\n\nTo match the variable `x` used in the problem title \"Integral of secx\", we replace `φ` with `x`.\n\n### **Final Definitive Answer**\n\nThe result of the definite integration is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

A map `f` between two surfaces equipped with complex coordinates `z` and `w` is conformal if and only if it is a holomorphic (complex analytic) function, `w = f(z)`. This requires defining appropriate complex coordinates for both the cylinder and the sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Complex Coordinate for the Cylinder**\n\nThe target surface is a cylinder. We can unwrap the cylinder into a flat plane. Let the cylinder have a radius `R`.\nThe horizontal position on this plane, `x_cyl`, corresponds to the longitude `λ` on the sphere, scaled by the radius: `x_cyl = Rλ`.\nThe vertical position on this plane, `y_cyl`, is defined as a function of the latitude `φ` on the sphere: `y_cyl = y(φ)`.\n\nFollowing the sub-strategy, we define a complex coordinate `w` for the cylinder:\n`w = x_cyl + i * y_cyl`\nSubstituting the definitions for `x_cyl` and `y_cyl`:\n`w = Rλ + i * y(φ)`\n\nThe metric (element of arc length squared) on the flat plane representing the unwrapped cylinder is the standard Euclidean metric: `ds_cyl² = dx_cyl² + dy_cyl²`.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Complex Coordinate for the Sphere**\n\nThe source surface is a sphere of radius `R`. The standard metric on the surface of a sphere in terms of latitude `φ` and longitude `λ` is:\n`ds_sphere² = R² dφ² + R² cos²(φ) dλ²`\n\nThe sub-strategy requires rewriting this metric into an \"isothermal\" form, `ds_sphere² = G(φ)(dψ² + dλ²)`, for some new coordinate `ψ(φ)`. This form is essential because it is conformally equivalent to a flat metric `dψ² + dλ²`.\n\nWe perform the necessary algebraic manipulation on the spherical metric:\n`ds_sphere² = R² (dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)`\n\nFactor out the term `cos²(φ)` from the expression inside the parentheses:\n`ds_sphere² = R² cos²(φ) [ (1/cos²(φ))dφ² + dλ² ]`\n\nRecognize that `1/cos(φ) = sec(φ)`. Therefore, `1/cos²(φ) = sec²(φ)`.\n`ds_sphere² = R² cos²(φ) [ sec²(φ)dφ² + dλ² ]`\n\nThis can be written as:\n`ds_sphere² = R² cos²(φ) [ (sec(φ)dφ)² + dλ² ]`\n\nNow, we define a new differential `dψ` as dictated by the structure of this expression and the sub-strategy:\n`dψ = sec(φ) dφ`\n\nSubstituting `dψ` into the metric equation gives:\n`ds_sphere² = R² cos²(φ) [ dψ² + dλ² ]`\n\nThis is precisely the isothermal form `G(φ)(dψ² + dλ²)` required by the sub-strategy, with the conformal factor `G(φ) = R² cos²(φ)`.\n\nWith the new coordinate `ψ`, we can now define the complex coordinate `z` for the sphere, as specified by the sub-strategy:\n`z = R(λ + iψ)`\n\n**Step 4: Asserting the Holomorphic Nature of the Map**\n\nThe map `f` from the sphere to the cylinder, `w = f(z)`, must be holomorphic to be conformal. The sub-strategy specifies using the simplest possible non-trivial holomorphic map, which is the identity function.\n\n**Step 5: Applying the Identity Map and Equating Components**\n\nWe set `w = z`:\n`Rλ + i * y(φ) = R(λ + iψ)`\n\nDistribute the `R` on the right side:\n`Rλ + i * y(φ) = Rλ + i * Rψ`\n\nFor two complex numbers to be equal, their real and imaginary parts must be equal.\nEquating the real parts:\n`Re(w) = Re(z)`\n`Rλ = Rλ`\nThis is a trivial identity, confirming the consistency of the longitude mapping.\n\nEquating the imaginary parts:\n`Im(w) = Im(z)`\n`y(φ) = Rψ`\n\nThis result provides the explicit form of the vertical coordinate `y(φ)` on the cylinder (the Mercator map) in terms of the sphere's modified coordinate `ψ`.\n\n**Step 6: Identifying and Calculating the Integral**\n\nFrom Step 3, we established the differential relationship defining `ψ`:\n`dψ = sec(φ) dφ`\n\nTo find the function `ψ(φ)`, we must integrate this differential expression.\n`ψ(φ) = ∫ dψ = ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\nFrom Step 5, we have `y(φ) = Rψ(φ)`. Substituting the integral form of `ψ(φ)` gives:\n`y(φ) = R * ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\nThe sub-strategy has now been followed to its conclusion, successfully demonstrating that the integral `∫ sec(φ) dφ` arises naturally as the fundamental component of the Mercator projection. The original problem asks for the evaluation of this integral. We now proceed with the formal calculation. The variable `φ` is a dummy variable of integration and can be replaced with `x` to match the original problem statement.\n\nWe must calculate `I = ∫ sec(x) dx`.\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the standard technique of multiplying the integrand by a factor of 1, specifically `(sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x))`.\n`I = ∫ sec(x) * (sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) dx`\n\nDistribute `sec(x)` in the numerator:\n`I = ∫ (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) dx`\n\nWe now use the method of u-substitution. Let `u = sec(x) + tan(x)`.\nWe find the differential `du` by differentiating `u` with respect to `x`:\n`du/dx = d/dx(sec(x) + tan(x))`\nThe derivative of `sec(x)` is `sec(x)tan(x)`.\nThe derivative of `tan(x)` is `sec²(x)`.\nSo, `du/dx = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)`.\n\nThis gives `du = (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx`.\nWe observe that the numerator of our integrand is precisely `du`, and the denominator is `u`.\nSubstituting `u` and `du` into the integral:\n`I = ∫ (1/u) du`\n\nThe integral of `1/u` is a standard result:\n`I = ln|u| + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for `u`:\n`I = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\nThis is the definitive, fully simplified solution to the integral.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe integral of `sec(x)` is `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`."

            "solutionAttempt": "The mathematical problem is to find the integral of `sec(x)`. The provided sub-strategy uses the variable `φ` (latitude); the final result will be stated in terms of `x`. The solution will be derived by meticulously and exclusively following the provided \"Loxodrome Preservation Approach\" sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the differential equation of a loxodrome on the sphere.**\n\nA loxodrome, or rhumb line, is a path on a sphere that maintains a constant bearing (angle) with respect to the meridians (lines of constant longitude). Let the sphere have radius `R`. We use a coordinate system where `φ` is the latitude and `λ` is the longitude.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal displacement `ds` along the loxodrome. This displacement has a component along a meridian, `ds_y`, and a component along a parallel of latitude, `ds_x`.\n\nThe infinitesimal change in arc length along a meridian corresponding to a change in latitude `dφ` is given by:\n`ds_y = R dφ`\n\nThe infinitesimal change in arc length along a parallel of latitude `φ` corresponding to a change in longitude `dλ` is given by:\n`ds_x = (R cos(φ)) dλ`\nThe term `R cos(φ)` is the radius of the circle of constant latitude `φ`.\n\nThe bearing `β` is the constant angle the loxodrome makes with the local meridian. The tangent of this angle is the ratio of the eastward displacement to the northward displacement:\n`tan(β) = ds_x / ds_y`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `ds_x` and `ds_y`:\n`tan(β) = (R cos(φ) dλ) / (R dφ)`\n\nThe constant radius `R` cancels out:\n`tan(β) = cos(φ) (dλ/dφ)`\n\nTo find the relationship between the change in longitude and the change in latitude along this path, we solve for `dλ/dφ`:\n`dλ/dφ = tan(β) / cos(φ)`\n\nUsing the definition of the secant function, `sec(φ) = 1/cos(φ)`, we arrive at the differential equation for a loxodrome:\n`dλ/dφ = tan(β) sec(φ)`\nThis completes the first step of the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 2: Define the mapping to the cylinder.**\n\nThe Mercator projection maps the spherical coordinates `(φ, λ)` to planar Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`. The sub-strategy defines this mapping as follows:\nThe horizontal coordinate `x` is proportional to the longitude `λ`:\n`x = Rλ`\nThe vertical coordinate `y` is a function of the latitude `φ` only:\n`y = y(φ)`\n\nThe core requirement of the sub-strategy is that a loxodrome on the sphere (a path of constant `β`) must map to a straight line on the plane. A straight line in the `(x, y)` plane is defined by a constant slope `m = dy/dx`.\n\n**Step 3: Use the chain rule to express the map slope `m` in terms of the derivatives on the sphere.**\n\nWe need to calculate the slope `m = dy/dx` for a path on the map that corresponds to the loxodrome on the sphere. Since `x` and `y` are parameterized by `φ` along this path (`x` via `λ(φ)` and `y` directly), we use the chain rule:\n`m = dy/dx = (dy/dφ) / (dx/dφ)`\n\nWe calculate each derivative separately:\nThe derivative of `y` with respect to `φ` is simply `y'(φ)`:\n`dy/dφ = y'(φ)`\n\nThe derivative of `x` with respect to `φ` requires using the chain rule again, since `x = Rλ` and `λ` is a function of `φ` along the loxodrome:\n`dx/dφ = d/dφ (Rλ) = R * (dλ/dφ)`\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for `m`:\n`m = y'(φ) / (R * dλ/dφ)`\nThis completes the third step of the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the loxodrome equation from Step 1 into the slope equation.**\n\nFrom Step 1, we have the loxodrome equation: `dλ/dφ = tan(β) sec(φ)`.\nFrom Step 3, we have the map slope: `m = y'(φ) / (R * dλ/dφ)`.\n\nWe substitute the expression for `dλ/dφ` into the denominator of the expression for `m`:\n`m = y'(φ) / (R * [tan(β) sec(φ)])`\n`m = y'(φ) / (R tan(β) sec(φ))`\nThis completes the fourth step of the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the condition for `m` to be constant.**\n\nFor the loxodrome to map to a straight line, its slope `m` on the map must be constant. The expression for `m` is `m = y'(φ) / (R tan(β) sec(φ))`.\n\nFor any given loxodrome, the bearing `β` is constant, so `tan(β)` is a constant. The radius `R` is also a constant. However, the expression contains the variable latitude `φ` within the terms `y'(φ)` and `sec(φ)`. For `m` to be independent of `φ`, the `φ`-dependency in the numerator must cancel the `φ`-dependency in the denominator.\n\nThis means that the function `y'(φ)` must be directly proportional to `sec(φ)`. Let us state this relationship with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n`y'(φ) = k sec(φ)`\n\nIf we substitute this form of `y'(φ)` back into the equation for `m`, we get:\n`m = (k sec(φ)) / (R tan(β) sec(φ))`\n\nThe `sec(φ)` terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n`m = k / (R tan(β))`\n\nSince `k`, `R`, and `β` are all constants, the slope `m` is indeed constant. This confirms that the requirement `y'(φ) ∝ sec(φ)` is the necessary condition to ensure all loxodromes become straight lines on the map. This completes the fifth step of the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 6: Establish the constant of proportionality and identify the integral.**\n\nThe sub-strategy dictates that the constant `k` is determined by requiring the map to be isotropic (conformal, having equal scaling in all directions) at every point. Let's analyze the map's scaling factors.\n\nThe scaling factor in the x-direction (east-west), `s_x`, is the ratio of map distance `dx` to the corresponding sphere distance `ds_x`:\n`s_x = dx / ds_x = (R dλ) / (R cos(φ) dλ) = 1 / cos(φ) = sec(φ)`\n\nThe scaling factor in the y-direction (north-south), `s_y`, is the ratio of map distance `dy` to the corresponding sphere distance `ds_y`:\n`dy = y'(φ) dφ`\n`s_y = dy / ds_y = (y'(φ) dφ) / (R dφ) = y'(φ) / R`\n\nFor the map to be isotropic, the scaling factors must be equal: `s_x = s_y`.\n`sec(φ) = y'(φ) / R`\n\nSolving for `y'(φ)`, we find the specific form of the derivative of our mapping function:\n`y'(φ) = R sec(φ)`\n\nThis result achieves two things:\n1.  It confirms the relationship from Step 5, `y'(φ) ∝ sec(φ)`.\n2.  It determines the constant of proportionality `k` to be the radius of the sphere, `R`.\n\nTo find the function `y(φ)`, we must integrate its derivative, `y'(φ)`, with respect to `φ`:\n`y(φ) = ∫ y'(φ) dφ = ∫ R sec(φ) dφ`\n\nSince `R` is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n`y(φ) = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\n**Conclusion on the Sufficiency of the Sub-Strategy**\n\nThe provided sub-strategy, \"The Loxodrome Preservation Approach,\" has been followed with absolute rigor. The steps have led to the conclusion that the vertical coordinate `y(φ)` of the Mercator projection is given by `y(φ) = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`. The problem of constructing the map has been successfully reduced to the problem of evaluating the integral of the secant function.\n\nThe sub-strategy concludes by \"...identifying the integral as the unique function that straightens all rhumb lines.\" The sub-strategy provides a complete and rigorous derivation for *why* the integral of secant must be calculated. However, the sub-strategy itself does not contain any further steps, instructions, or mathematical techniques for the evaluation of the resulting integral, `∫ sec(φ) dφ`.\n\nTherefore, the sub-strategy, when followed exclusively and to its full extent, is insufficient to derive the final, definitive, fully simplified answer to the original problem (\"Integral of secx\"). It successfully establishes the problem's formulation in terms of an integral but provides no mechanism for its solution. My execution of the sub-strategy concludes at this step, as any further action would constitute a deviation from the provided instructions. The sub-strategy is demonstrably incomplete for the task of finding the closed-form antiderivative."

            "solutionAttempt": "Herein is the rigorous derivation of the integral of sec(x) by exclusively applying the specified sub-strategy.\n\nThe problem is to find the integral of sec(x). The provided sub-strategy outlines a method based on the principles of conformal mapping, specifically the construction of the Mercator projection. This derivation will follow the sub-strategy's steps without deviation to arrive at the solution. The variable `x` in the original problem statement corresponds to the latitude variable, denoted by `φ`, in the geometric derivation.\n\n**Step 1: Define the infinitesimal displacement on the surface of a sphere.**\nLet a sphere have radius `R`. A point on its surface is defined by its latitude `φ` and longitude `λ`. The squared infinitesimal distance, `ds²`, between two nearby points `(φ, λ)` and `(φ + dφ, λ + dλ)` is given by the metric for spherical coordinates:\n`ds² = R² dφ² + R² cos²(φ) dλ²`\nThis can be factored as:\n`ds² = R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)`.\nAn infinitesimal circle centered at `(φ, λ)` is the set of all points reached by infinitesimal displacements `(dφ, dλ)` for which this `ds²` is constant.\n\n**Step 2: Define the projection and the corresponding displacement on the image plane.**\nThe sub-strategy specifies a projection `F` from the sphere to a cylindrical surface (which can be unrolled into a plane) with coordinates `(x, y)`. The projection is defined as:\n`x = Rλ`\n`y = y(φ)`\nwhere `y(φ)` is a function of latitude to be determined.\n\nWe now compute the squared infinitesimal distance on the image plane, `d(image)²`, which is given by the standard Euclidean metric `dx² + dy²`.\nFirst, we find the differentials `dx` and `dy` in terms of `dφ` and `dλ` using the chain rule:\n`dx = (∂x/∂λ) dλ + (∂x/∂φ) dφ = R dλ + 0 dφ = R dλ`\n`dy = (∂y/∂λ) dλ + (∂y/∂φ) dφ = 0 dλ + y'(φ) dφ = y'(φ) dφ`\nwhere `y'(φ)` denotes `dy/dφ`.\n\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for the squared distance on the image:\n`d(image)² = dx² + dy² = (R dλ)² + (y'(φ) dφ)²`\n`d(image)² = R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ²`\n\n**Step 3: Impose the condition of conformality.**\nA map is conformal if it preserves angles. A consequence of this is that the scaling of length at any given point is isotropic, meaning it is the same in all directions. This implies that an infinitesimal circle on the original surface must be mapped to an infinitesimal circle on the image surface.\n\n**Step 4: Formalize the conformal condition using a scaling factor.**\nThe condition of isotropic scaling requires that the ratio of the squared distance on the image, `d(image)²`, to the squared distance on the sphere, `ds²`, must be a scaling factor that depends only on the position `(φ, λ)`, and not on the direction of the displacement (i.e., not on the ratio of `dφ` to `dλ`). We denote this squared scaling factor as `Ω²`. Given that the projection's y-component depends only on `φ` and the x-component depends linearly on `λ`, the scaling factor can only be a function of `φ`. Thus, we write `Ω²(φ)`.\nThe formal condition is:\n`d(image)² / ds² = Ω²(φ)`\n\n**Step 5: Set up the equation for coefficient comparison.**\nWe substitute the expressions for `d(image)²` (from Step 2) and `ds²` (from Step 1) into the conformality equation from Step 4:\n`[R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ²] / [R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)] = Ω²(φ)`\n\nTo facilitate the comparison of coefficients, we rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator:\n`R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ² = Ω²(φ) * [R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)]`\nDistributing `Ω²(φ)R²` on the right-hand side yields:\n`R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ² = Ω²(φ) R² dφ² + Ω²(φ) R² cos²(φ) dλ²`\n\nFor this equation to be true for any arbitrary infinitesimal displacements `dφ` and `dλ`, the terms involving `dφ²` must be equal on both sides, and the terms involving `dλ²` must also be equal on both sides.\n\n**Step 6: Derive two equations by comparing the coefficients of the differentials.**\nBy equating the coefficients of `dλ²` from both sides of the equation in Step 5, we obtain our first equation:\nEquation 1: `R² = Ω²(φ) R² cos²(φ)`\n\nBy equating the coefficients of `dφ²` from both sides, we obtain our second equation:\nEquation 2: `(y'(φ))² = Ω²(φ) R²`\n\n**Step 7: Solve the system of equations to find an expression for y'(φ).**\nWe begin by solving Equation 1 for the scaling factor `Ω²(φ)`. Assuming the radius `R` is non-zero (`R ≠ 0`), we can divide both sides by `R²`:\n`1 = Ω²(φ) cos²(φ)`\n\nTo isolate `Ω²(φ)`, we divide by `cos²(φ)`. This is permissible for all latitudes except the poles (`φ ≠ ±π/2`), where `cos(φ) = 0`.\n`Ω²(φ) = 1 / cos²(φ) = sec²(φ)`\n\nNow, we substitute this result for `Ω²(φ)` into Equation 2:\n`(y'(φ))² = (sec²(φ)) R²`\n\nTo find `y'(φ)`, we take the square root of both sides:\n`y'(φ) = ±√(R² sec²(φ))`\n`y'(φ) = ±|R sec(φ)|`\n\nBy convention for the Mercator projection, we choose the positive sign so that increasing latitude corresponds to an increasing y-coordinate. Furthermore, for the typical domain of the map, `-π/2 < φ < π/2`, the cosine function is positive, so `sec(φ)` is also positive. Thus, we can remove the absolute value signs:\n`y'(φ) = R sec(φ)`\n\nThis completes the derivation outlined by the provided sub-strategy, yielding the differential equation that governs the vertical coordinate of the conformal projection.\n\n**Final Step: Integration to Solve the Original Problem**\nThe original problem is to find the integral of `sec(x)`. The sub-strategy has led to the differential equation `dy/dφ = R sec(φ)`. To find the function `y(φ)`, we must integrate its derivative:\n`y(φ) = ∫ (dy/dφ) dφ = ∫ R sec(φ) dφ = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\nSolving the original problem is equivalent to evaluating the integral `∫ sec(φ) dφ` (or `∫ sec(x) dx`, as the variable name is immaterial). Let us now compute this integral.\nThe standard technique involves multiplying the integrand by a factor of 1 in a specific form:\n`∫ sec(φ) dφ = ∫ sec(φ) * [ (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) ] dφ`\n\nDistributing `sec(φ)` in the numerator gives:\n`∫ [ sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ) ] / [ sec(φ) + tan(φ) ] dφ`\n\nWe now use the method of substitution. Let `u = sec(φ) + tan(φ)`.\nWe find the differential `du` by differentiating `u` with respect to `φ`:\n`du/dφ = d/dφ(sec(φ) + tan(φ)) = d/dφ(sec(φ)) + d/dφ(tan(φ))`\nThe derivatives are:\n`d/dφ(sec(φ)) = sec(φ)tan(φ)`\n`d/dφ(tan(φ)) = sec²(φ)`\nSo, `du/dφ = sec(φ)tan(φ) + sec²(φ)`.\nThis means `du = (sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ)) dφ`.\n\nWe observe that the numerator of our integral is precisely `du` and the denominator is `u`. Substituting these into the integral:\n`∫ (1/u) du`\n\nThis is a standard integral form, which evaluates to:\n`ln|u| + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for `u`:\n`ln|sec(φ) + tan(φ)| + C`\n\nReplacing the dummy variable `φ` with the variable `x` from the original problem statement, we arrive at the final, definitive answer.\n\nThe integral of sec(x) is:\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

Present your final judgment as a JSON object with the following structure: `{\"best_solution_id\": \"ID of the winning solution\", \"best_solution_text\": \"The full text of the winning solution, potentially corrected or clarified by you for perfection.\", \"reasoning\": \"A detailed, step-by-step explanation of why this solution is superior to the others.\"}`\n\nAttempted Solutions:\n--- SOLUTION 1 (ID: main1-sub0) ---\nHerein is the rigorous derivation of the integral of sec(x) by exclusive adherence to the specified sub-strategy.\n\n### **Preamble: Conforming to the Sub-Strategy**\n\nThe provided sub-strategy dictates a derivation from the first principles of conformality. The goal is to find the function `y(φ)` for the Mercator projection `F(φ, λ) = (Rλ, y(φ))`, where `φ` is latitude and `λ` is longitude on a sphere of radius `R`. This will lead to a differential equation for `y'(φ)`, the solution of which requires finding the integral of the secant function.\n\n### **Step 1: Definition of Tangent Vectors on the Sphere**\n\nLet the sphere S² of radius `R` be parameterized by latitude `φ` and longitude `λ`. The tangent space `T_P(S²) ` at any point `P = (φ, λ)` is a two-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis vectors `∂/∂φ` and `∂/∂λ`.\n\nAn arbitrary tangent vector `v` in this space can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors:\n`v = a(∂/∂φ) + b(∂/∂λ)`\nwhere `a` and `b` are scalar components.\n\nAs per the sub-strategy, we define two arbitrary tangent vectors, `v1` and `v2`, at the point `(φ, λ)`:\n`v1 = a1(∂/∂φ) + b1(∂/∂λ)`\n`v2 = a2(∂/∂φ) + b2(∂/∂λ)`\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation of the Angle on the Sphere**\n\nTo calculate the angle `θ_sphere` between `v1` and `v2`, we first require the metric tensor `g_sphere` of the sphere. The standard parameterization of the sphere in Euclidean coordinates `(x, y, z)` is:\n`r(φ, λ) = (R cos(φ) cos(λ), R cos(φ) sin(λ), R sin(φ))`\n\nThe basis tangent vectors are the partial derivatives of `r`:\n`r_φ = ∂r/∂φ = (-R sin(φ) cos(λ), -R sin(φ) sin(λ), R cos(φ))`\n`r_λ = ∂r/∂λ = (-R cos(φ) sin(λ), R cos(φ) cos(λ), 0)`\n\nThe components of the metric tensor `g_ij` are the dot products of these basis vectors:\n`g_φφ = r_φ · r_φ = (-R sinφ cosλ)² + (-R sinφ sinλ)² + (R cosφ)² = R²sin²φ(cos²λ + sin²λ) + R²cos²φ = R²(sin²φ + cos²φ) = R²`\n`g_λλ = r_λ · r_λ = (-R cosφ sinλ)² + (R cosφ cosλ)² + 0² = R²cos²φ(sin²λ + cos²λ) = R²cos²φ`\n`g_φλ = g_λφ = r_φ · r_λ = R²sinφcosφcosλsinλ - R²sinφcosφsinλcosλ = 0`\n\nThus, the spherical metric tensor in the `(φ, λ)` coordinate system is:\n`g_sphere = [ g_φφ  g_φλ ] = [ R²      0     ]`\n`          [ g_λφ  g_λλ ]   [ 0    R²cos²φ ]`\n\nThe inner product of `v1` and `v2` is `g_sphere(v1, v2)`. Using the component representation `v1 = (a1, b1)` and `v2 = (a2, b2)`:\n`g_sphere(v1, v2) = [a1, b1] [ R²      0     ] [a2] = a1a2R² + b1b2R²cos²φ`\n`                           [ 0    R²cos²φ ] [b2]`\n\nThe squared magnitudes of the vectors are:\n`||v1||_sphere² = g_sphere(v1, v1) = a1²R² + b1²R²cos²φ`\n`||v2||_sphere² = g_sphere(v2, v2) = a2²R² + b2²R²cos²φ`\n\nThe cosine of the angle `θ_sphere` between `v1` and `v2` is given by the formula:\n`cos(θ_sphere) = g_sphere(v1, v2) / (||v1||_sphere * ||v2||_sphere)`\n`cos(θ_sphere) = (a1a2R² + b1b2R²cos²φ) / sqrt((a1²R² + b1²R²cos²φ) * (a2²R² + b2²R²cos²φ))`\n\n### **Step 3: Pushforward to the Cylindrical Map**\n\nThe Mercator projection is a map `F` from the sphere's coordinates `(φ, λ)` to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)` on a plane (representing the unrolled cylinder). The map is defined as:\n`F(φ, λ) = (x(φ, λ), y(φ, λ)) = (Rλ, y(φ))`\nwhere `y(φ)` is the function we seek to determine.\n\nThe pushforward map `F_*` transforms tangent vectors from the sphere to the plane. It is represented by the Jacobian matrix of `F`:\n`F_* = J(F) = [ ∂x/∂φ  ∂x/∂λ ] = [ 0      R   ]`\n`             [ ∂y/∂φ  ∂y/∂λ ]   [ y'(φ)  0   ]`\nwhere `y'(φ) = dy/dφ`.\n\nWe apply `F_*` to the components of `v1` and `v2` to find their images, `w1` and `w2`, in the tangent space of the plane:\n`w1 = F_*(v1) = [ 0  R ] [a1] = [ Rb1   ]`. In the basis `(∂/∂x, ∂/∂y)`, this is `w1 = Rb1(∂/∂x) + a1y'(φ)(∂/∂y)`.\n`                  [ y' 0 ] [b1]   [ a1y' ]`\n`w2 = F_*(v2) = [ 0  R ] [a2] = [ Rb2   ]`. In the basis `(∂/∂x, ∂/∂y)`, this is `w2 = Rb2(∂/∂x) + a2y'(φ)(∂/∂y)`.\n`                  [ y' 0 ] [b2]   [ a2y' ]`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculation of the Angle on the Map**\n\nThe angle `θ_map` between `w1` and `w2` is calculated using the standard Euclidean metric on the plane, which is the identity matrix `g_Euc = I`. The inner product is the standard dot product.\nThe component representations of the mapped vectors are `w1 = (Rb1, a1y'(φ))` and `w2 = (Rb2, a2y'(φ))`.\n\nThe Euclidean inner product is:\n`g_Euc(w1, w2) = w1 · w2 = (Rb1)(Rb2) + (a1y'(φ))(a2y'(φ)) = R²b1b2 + (y'(φ))²a1a2`\n\nThe squared magnitudes are:\n`||w1||_map² = g_Euc(w1, w1) = (Rb1)² + (a1y'(φ))² = R²b1² + (y'(φ))²a1²`\n`||w2||_map² = g_Euc(w2, w2) = (Rb2)² + (a2y'(φ))² = R²b2² + (y'(φ))²a2²`\n\nThe cosine of the angle `θ_map` is:\n`cos(θ_map) = g_Euc(w1, w2) / (||w1||_map * ||w2||_map)`\n`cos(θ_map) = ((y'(φ))²a1a2 + R²b1b2) / sqrt(((y'(φ))²a1² + R²b1²) * ((y'(φ))²a2² + R²b2²))`\n\n### **Step 5: Imposition of the Conformality Axiom**\n\nA map is conformal if it preserves angles. Therefore, we must impose the condition `θ_sphere = θ_map` for any choice of vectors `v1` and `v2`. This is equivalent to equating their cosines:\n`cos(θ_sphere) = cos(θ_map)`\n\n`(a1a2R² + b1b2R²cos²φ) / sqrt((a1²R² + b1²R²cos²φ)(a2²R² + b2²R²cos²φ)) = ((y'(φ))²a1a2 + R²b1b2) / sqrt(((y'(φ))²a1² + R²b1²)((y'(φ))²a2² + R²b2²))`\n\n### **Step 6: Derivation of the Differential Equation**\n\nThe equality from Step 5 must hold for all possible values of `a1, b1, a2, b2`. This is a powerful constraint. An expression of the form `(Aa1a2 + Bb1b2) / sqrt((Aa1² + Bb1²)(Aa2² + Bb2²))` is determined solely by the ratio `A/B`. For the two cosine expressions to be equal for all vectors, the structure of their dependence on the vector components must be identical. This implies that the ratio of the coefficients of the `a_i a_j` terms to the `b_i b_j` terms must be the same in both expressions.\n\nLet's compare the coefficients:\nFrom `cos(θ_sphere)`, the coefficient of `a1a2` terms is `R²`, and the coefficient of `b1b2` terms is `R²cos²φ`.\nThe ratio is `(R²) / (R²cos²φ) = sec²φ`.\n\nFrom `cos(θ_map)`, the coefficient of `a1a2` terms is `(y'(φ))²`, and the coefficient of `b1b2` terms is `R²`.\nThe ratio is `(y'(φ))² / R²`.\n\nFor the angle formulas to be identical, these ratios must be equal:\n`(y'(φ))² / R² = sec²φ`\n\nMultiplying by `R²` gives the relationship:\n`(y'(φ))² = R²sec²φ`\n\nTaking the square root of both sides yields:\n`y'(φ) = ± R sec(φ)`\n\nBy convention, the map is defined such that y increases with increasing latitude φ (for φ in (-π/2, π/2)), so we choose the positive root:\n`y'(φ) = R sec(φ)`\n\nThis is the fundamental differential equation for the Mercator projection, derived directly from the axiom of conformality as required by the sub-strategy.\n\n### **Step 7: Solution of the Integral**\n\nThe original problem is to find the integral of `sec(x)`. Our derivation has shown that the Mercator coordinate `y(φ)` is the integral of `R sec(φ)`.\n`y(φ) = ∫ R sec(φ) dφ = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\nTo solve `∫ sec(φ) dφ`, we use the standard technique of multiplying the integrand by `1` in the form of `(sec(φ) + tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ))`:\n`∫ sec(φ) dφ = ∫ sec(φ) * (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) dφ`\n`= ∫ (sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) dφ`\n\nWe perform a u-substitution. Let:\n`u = sec(φ) + tan(φ)`\n\nNow, we find the differential `du`:\n`du/dφ = d/dφ(sec(φ)) + d/dφ(tan(φ))`\nThe derivatives are `d/dφ(sec(φ)) = sec(φ)tan(φ)` and `d/dφ(tan(φ)) = sec²(φ)`.\nSo, `du/dφ = sec(φ)tan(φ) + sec²(φ)`.\nThis gives `du = (sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ)) dφ`.\n\nSubstituting `u` and `du` into the integral, we find that the numerator is exactly `du` and the denominator is `u`:\n`∫ (1/u) du`\n\nThe integral of `1/u` is `ln|u| + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration.\nSubstituting back for `u`, we obtain the result:\n`∫ sec(φ) dφ = ln|sec(φ) + tan(φ)| + C`\n\nTo match the variable `x` used in the problem title \"Integral of secx\", we replace `φ` with `x`.\n\n### **Final Definitive Answer**\n\nThe result of the definite integration is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\n--- SOLUTION 2 (ID: main1-sub1) ---\nThe objective is to compute the integral of sec(x) by rigorously and exclusively following the provided sub-strategy. The variable `x` in the original problem corresponds to the latitude angle `φ` in the context of the sub-strategy's geometric setup. For consistency with the sub-strategy's notation, the derivation will proceed using the variable `φ`, and the final result will be expressed in terms of `x`.\n\n**Step 1: Establishing the Framework of a Conformal Map**\n\nThe sub-strategy mandates recasting the problem in the language of complex analysis, specifically concerning a conformal (angle-preserving) map from a sphere to a cylinder. Such a map is known as a Mercator projection. A map `f` between two surfaces equipped with complex coordinates `z` and `w` is conformal if and only if it is a holomorphic (complex analytic) function, `w = f(z)`. This requires defining appropriate complex coordinates for both the cylinder and the sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Complex Coordinate for the Cylinder**\n\nThe target surface is a cylinder. We can unwrap the cylinder into a flat plane. Let the cylinder have a radius `R`.\nThe horizontal position on this plane, `x_cyl`, corresponds to the longitude `λ` on the sphere, scaled by the radius: `x_cyl = Rλ`.\nThe vertical position on this plane, `y_cyl`, is defined as a function of the latitude `φ` on the sphere: `y_cyl = y(φ)`.\n\nFollowing the sub-strategy, we define a complex coordinate `w` for the cylinder:\n`w = x_cyl + i * y_cyl`\nSubstituting the definitions for `x_cyl` and `y_cyl`:\n`w = Rλ + i * y(φ)`\n\nThe metric (element of arc length squared) on the flat plane representing the unwrapped cylinder is the standard Euclidean metric: `ds_cyl² = dx_cyl² + dy_cyl²`.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Complex Coordinate for the Sphere**\n\nThe source surface is a sphere of radius `R`. The standard metric on the surface of a sphere in terms of latitude `φ` and longitude `λ` is:\n`ds_sphere² = R² dφ² + R² cos²(φ) dλ²`\n\nThe sub-strategy requires rewriting this metric into an \"isothermal\" form, `ds_sphere² = G(φ)(dψ² + dλ²)`, for some new coordinate `ψ(φ)`. This form is essential because it is conformally equivalent to a flat metric `dψ² + dλ²`.\n\nWe perform the necessary algebraic manipulation on the spherical metric:\n`ds_sphere² = R² (dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)`\n\nFactor out the term `cos²(φ)` from the expression inside the parentheses:\n`ds_sphere² = R² cos²(φ) [ (1/cos²(φ))dφ² + dλ² ]`\n\nRecognize that `1/cos(φ) = sec(φ)`. Therefore, `1/cos²(φ) = sec²(φ)`.\n`ds_sphere² = R² cos²(φ) [ sec²(φ)dφ² + dλ² ]`\n\nThis can be written as:\n`ds_sphere² = R² cos²(φ) [ (sec(φ)dφ)² + dλ² ]`\n\nNow, we define a new differential `dψ` as dictated by the structure of this expression and the sub-strategy:\n`dψ = sec(φ) dφ`\n\nSubstituting `dψ` into the metric equation gives:\n`ds_sphere² = R² cos²(φ) [ dψ² + dλ² ]`\n\nThis is precisely the isothermal form `G(φ)(dψ² + dλ²)` required by the sub-strategy, with the conformal factor `G(φ) = R² cos²(φ)`.\n\nWith the new coordinate `ψ`, we can now define the complex coordinate `z` for the sphere, as specified by the sub-strategy:\n`z = R(λ + iψ)`\n\n**Step 4: Asserting the Holomorphic Nature of the Map**\n\nThe map `f` from the sphere to the cylinder, `w = f(z)`, must be holomorphic to be conformal. The sub-strategy specifies using the simplest possible non-trivial holomorphic map, which is the identity function.\n\n**Step 5: Applying the Identity Map and Equating Components**\n\nWe set `w = z`:\n`Rλ + i * y(φ) = R(λ + iψ)`\n\nDistribute the `R` on the right side:\n`Rλ + i * y(φ) = Rλ + i * Rψ`\n\nFor two complex numbers to be equal, their real and imaginary parts must be equal.\nEquating the real parts:\n`Re(w) = Re(z)`\n`Rλ = Rλ`\nThis is a trivial identity, confirming the consistency of the longitude mapping.\n\nEquating the imaginary parts:\n`Im(w) = Im(z)`\n`y(φ) = Rψ`\n\nThis result provides the explicit form of the vertical coordinate `y(φ)` on the cylinder (the Mercator map) in terms of the sphere's modified coordinate `ψ`.\n\n**Step 6: Identifying and Calculating the Integral**\n\nFrom Step 3, we established the differential relationship defining `ψ`:\n`dψ = sec(φ) dφ`\n\nTo find the function `ψ(φ)`, we must integrate this differential expression.\n`ψ(φ) = ∫ dψ = ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\nFrom Step 5, we have `y(φ) = Rψ(φ)`. Substituting the integral form of `ψ(φ)` gives:\n`y(φ) = R * ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\nThe sub-strategy has now been followed to its conclusion, successfully demonstrating that the integral `∫ sec(φ) dφ` arises naturally as the fundamental component of the Mercator projection. The original problem asks for the evaluation of this integral. We now proceed with the formal calculation. The variable `φ` is a dummy variable of integration and can be replaced with `x` to match the original problem statement.\n\nWe must calculate `I = ∫ sec(x) dx`.\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the standard technique of multiplying the integrand by a factor of 1, specifically `(sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x))`.\n`I = ∫ sec(x) * (sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) dx`\n\nDistribute `sec(x)` in the numerator:\n`I = ∫ (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) dx`\n\nWe now use the method of u-substitution. Let `u = sec(x) + tan(x)`.\nWe find the differential `du` by differentiating `u` with respect to `x`:\n`du/dx = d/dx(sec(x) + tan(x))`\nThe derivative of `sec(x)` is `sec(x)tan(x)`.\nThe derivative of `tan(x)` is `sec²(x)`.\nSo, `du/dx = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)`.\n\nThis gives `du = (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx`.\nWe observe that the numerator of our integrand is precisely `du`, and the denominator is `u`.\nSubstituting `u` and `du` into the integral:\n`I = ∫ (1/u) du`\n\nThe integral of `1/u` is a standard result:\n`I = ln|u| + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for `u`:\n`I = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\nThis is the definitive, fully simplified solution to the integral.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe integral of `sec(x)` is `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`.\n\n--- SOLUTION 3 (ID: main1-sub2) ---\nThe mathematical problem is to find the integral of `sec(x)`. The provided sub-strategy uses the variable `φ` (latitude); the final result will be stated in terms of `x`. The solution will be derived by meticulously and exclusively following the provided \"Loxodrome Preservation Approach\" sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the differential equation of a loxodrome on the sphere.**\n\nA loxodrome, or rhumb line, is a path on a sphere that maintains a constant bearing (angle) with respect to the meridians (lines of constant longitude). Let the sphere have radius `R`. We use a coordinate system where `φ` is the latitude and `λ` is the longitude.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal displacement `ds` along the loxodrome. This displacement has a component along a meridian, `ds_y`, and a component along a parallel of latitude, `ds_x`.\n\nThe infinitesimal change in arc length along a meridian corresponding to a change in latitude `dφ` is given by:\n`ds_y = R dφ`\n\nThe infinitesimal change in arc length along a parallel of latitude `φ` corresponding to a change in longitude `dλ` is given by:\n`ds_x = (R cos(φ)) dλ`\nThe term `R cos(φ)` is the radius of the circle of constant latitude `φ`.\n\nThe bearing `β` is the constant angle the loxodrome makes with the local meridian. The tangent of this angle is the ratio of the eastward displacement to the northward displacement:\n`tan(β) = ds_x / ds_y`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `ds_x` and `ds_y`:\n`tan(β) = (R cos(φ) dλ) / (R dφ)`\n\nThe constant radius `R` cancels out:\n`tan(β) = cos(φ) (dλ/dφ)`\n\nTo find the relationship between the change in longitude and the change in latitude along this path, we solve for `dλ/dφ`:\n`dλ/dφ = tan(β) / cos(φ)`\n\nUsing the definition of the secant function, `sec(φ) = 1/cos(φ)`, we arrive at the differential equation for a loxodrome:\n`dλ/dφ = tan(β) sec(φ)`\nThis completes the first step of the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 2: Define the mapping to the cylinder.**\n\nThe Mercator projection maps the spherical coordinates `(φ, λ)` to planar Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`. The sub-strategy defines this mapping as follows:\nThe horizontal coordinate `x` is proportional to the longitude `λ`:\n`x = Rλ`\nThe vertical coordinate `y` is a function of the latitude `φ` only:\n`y = y(φ)`\n\nThe core requirement of the sub-strategy is that a loxodrome on the sphere (a path of constant `β`) must map to a straight line on the plane. A straight line in the `(x, y)` plane is defined by a constant slope `m = dy/dx`.\n\n**Step 3: Use the chain rule to express the map slope `m` in terms of the derivatives on the sphere.**\n\nWe need to calculate the slope `m = dy/dx` for a path on the map that corresponds to the loxodrome on the sphere. Since `x` and `y` are parameterized by `φ` along this path (`x` via `λ(φ)` and `y` directly), we use the chain rule:\n`m = dy/dx = (dy/dφ) / (dx/dφ)`\n\nWe calculate each derivative separately:\nThe derivative of `y` with respect to `φ` is simply `y'(φ)`:\n`dy/dφ = y'(φ)`\n\nThe derivative of `x` with respect to `φ` requires using the chain rule again, since `x = Rλ` and `λ` is a function of `φ` along the loxodrome:\n`dx/dφ = d/dφ (Rλ) = R * (dλ/dφ)`\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for `m`:\n`m = y'(φ) / (R * dλ/dφ)`\nThis completes the third step of the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the loxodrome equation from Step 1 into the slope equation.**\n\nFrom Step 1, we have the loxodrome equation: `dλ/dφ = tan(β) sec(φ)`.\nFrom Step 3, we have the map slope: `m = y'(φ) / (R * dλ/dφ)`.\n\nWe substitute the expression for `dλ/dφ` into the denominator of the expression for `m`:\n`m = y'(φ) / (R * [tan(β) sec(φ)])`\n`m = y'(φ) / (R tan(β) sec(φ))`\nThis completes the fourth step of the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the condition for `m` to be constant.**\n\nFor the loxodrome to map to a straight line, its slope `m` on the map must be constant. The expression for `m` is `m = y'(φ) / (R tan(β) sec(φ))`.\n\nFor any given loxodrome, the bearing `β` is constant, so `tan(β)` is a constant. The radius `R` is also a constant. However, the expression contains the variable latitude `φ` within the terms `y'(φ)` and `sec(φ)`. For `m` to be independent of `φ`, the `φ`-dependency in the numerator must cancel the `φ`-dependency in the denominator.\n\nThis means that the function `y'(φ)` must be directly proportional to `sec(φ)`. Let us state this relationship with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n`y'(φ) = k sec(φ)`\n\nIf we substitute this form of `y'(φ)` back into the equation for `m`, we get:\n`m = (k sec(φ)) / (R tan(β) sec(φ))`\n\nThe `sec(φ)` terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n`m = k / (R tan(β))`\n\nSince `k`, `R`, and `β` are all constants, the slope `m` is indeed constant. This confirms that the requirement `y'(φ) ∝ sec(φ)` is the necessary condition to ensure all loxodromes become straight lines on the map. This completes the fifth step of the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 6: Establish the constant of proportionality and identify the integral.**\n\nThe sub-strategy dictates that the constant `k` is determined by requiring the map to be isotropic (conformal, having equal scaling in all directions) at every point. Let's analyze the map's scaling factors.\n\nThe scaling factor in the x-direction (east-west), `s_x`, is the ratio of map distance `dx` to the corresponding sphere distance `ds_x`:\n`s_x = dx / ds_x = (R dλ) / (R cos(φ) dλ) = 1 / cos(φ) = sec(φ)`\n\nThe scaling factor in the y-direction (north-south), `s_y`, is the ratio of map distance `dy` to the corresponding sphere distance `ds_y`:\n`dy = y'(φ) dφ`\n`s_y = dy / ds_y = (y'(φ) dφ) / (R dφ) = y'(φ) / R`\n\nFor the map to be isotropic, the scaling factors must be equal: `s_x = s_y`.\n`sec(φ) = y'(φ) / R`\n\nSolving for `y'(φ)`, we find the specific form of the derivative of our mapping function:\n`y'(φ) = R sec(φ)`\n\nThis result achieves two things:\n1.  It confirms the relationship from Step 5, `y'(φ) ∝ sec(φ)`.\n2.  It determines the constant of proportionality `k` to be the radius of the sphere, `R`.\n\nTo find the function `y(φ)`, we must integrate its derivative, `y'(φ)`, with respect to `φ`:\n`y(φ) = ∫ y'(φ) dφ = ∫ R sec(φ) dφ`\n\nSince `R` is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n`y(φ) = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\n**Conclusion on the Sufficiency of the Sub-Strategy**\n\nThe provided sub-strategy, \"The Loxodrome Preservation Approach,\" has been followed with absolute rigor. The steps have led to the conclusion that the vertical coordinate `y(φ)` of the Mercator projection is given by `y(φ) = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`. The problem of constructing the map has been successfully reduced to the problem of evaluating the integral of the secant function.\n\nThe sub-strategy concludes by \"...identifying the integral as the unique function that straightens all rhumb lines.\" The sub-strategy provides a complete and rigorous derivation for *why* the integral of secant must be calculated. However, the sub-strategy itself does not contain any further steps, instructions, or mathematical techniques for the evaluation of the resulting integral, `∫ sec(φ) dφ`.\n\nTherefore, the sub-strategy, when followed exclusively and to its full extent, is insufficient to derive the final, definitive, fully simplified answer to the original problem (\"Integral of secx\"). It successfully establishes the problem's formulation in terms of an integral but provides no mechanism for its solution. My execution of the sub-strategy concludes at this step, as any further action would constitute a deviation from the provided instructions. The sub-strategy is demonstrably incomplete for the task of finding the closed-form antiderivative.\n\n--- SOLUTION 4 (ID: main1-sub3) ---\nHerein is the rigorous derivation of the integral of sec(x) by exclusively applying the specified sub-strategy.\n\nThe problem is to find the integral of sec(x). The provided sub-strategy outlines a method based on the principles of conformal mapping, specifically the construction of the Mercator projection. This derivation will follow the sub-strategy's steps without deviation to arrive at the solution. The variable `x` in the original problem statement corresponds to the latitude variable, denoted by `φ`, in the geometric derivation.\n\n**Step 1: Define the infinitesimal displacement on the surface of a sphere.**\nLet a sphere have radius `R`. A point on its surface is defined by its latitude `φ` and longitude `λ`. The squared infinitesimal distance, `ds²`, between two nearby points `(φ, λ)` and `(φ + dφ, λ + dλ)` is given by the metric for spherical coordinates:\n`ds² = R² dφ² + R² cos²(φ) dλ²`\nThis can be factored as:\n`ds² = R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)`.\nAn infinitesimal circle centered at `(φ, λ)` is the set of all points reached by infinitesimal displacements `(dφ, dλ)` for which this `ds²` is constant.\n\n**Step 2: Define the projection and the corresponding displacement on the image plane.**\nThe sub-strategy specifies a projection `F` from the sphere to a cylindrical surface (which can be unrolled into a plane) with coordinates `(x, y)`. The projection is defined as:\n`x = Rλ`\n`y = y(φ)`\nwhere `y(φ)` is a function of latitude to be determined.\n\nWe now compute the squared infinitesimal distance on the image plane, `d(image)²`, which is given by the standard Euclidean metric `dx² + dy²`.\nFirst, we find the differentials `dx` and `dy` in terms of `dφ` and `dλ` using the chain rule:\n`dx = (∂x/∂λ) dλ + (∂x/∂φ) dφ = R dλ + 0 dφ = R dλ`\n`dy = (∂y/∂λ) dλ + (∂y/∂φ) dφ = 0 dλ + y'(φ) dφ = y'(φ) dφ`\nwhere `y'(φ)` denotes `dy/dφ`.\n\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for the squared distance on the image:\n`d(image)² = dx² + dy² = (R dλ)² + (y'(φ) dφ)²`\n`d(image)² = R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ²`\n\n**Step 3: Impose the condition of conformality.**\nA map is conformal if it preserves angles. A consequence of this is that the scaling of length at any given point is isotropic, meaning it is the same in all directions. This implies that an infinitesimal circle on the original surface must be mapped to an infinitesimal circle on the image surface.\n\n**Step 4: Formalize the conformal condition using a scaling factor.**\nThe condition of isotropic scaling requires that the ratio of the squared distance on the image, `d(image)²`, to the squared distance on the sphere, `ds²`, must be a scaling factor that depends only on the position `(φ, λ)`, and not on the direction of the displacement (i.e., not on the ratio of `dφ` to `dλ`). We denote this squared scaling factor as `Ω²`. Given that the projection's y-component depends only on `φ` and the x-component depends linearly on `λ`, the scaling factor can only be a function of `φ`. Thus, we write `Ω²(φ)`.\nThe formal condition is:\n`d(image)² / ds² = Ω²(φ)`\n\n**Step 5: Set up the equation for coefficient comparison.**\nWe substitute the expressions for `d(image)²` (from Step 2) and `ds²` (from Step 1) into the conformality equation from Step 4:\n`[R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ²] / [R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)] = Ω²(φ)`\n\nTo facilitate the comparison of coefficients, we rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator:\n`R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ² = Ω²(φ) * [R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)]`\nDistributing `Ω²(φ)R²` on the right-hand side yields:\n`R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ² = Ω²(φ) R² dφ² + Ω²(φ) R² cos²(φ) dλ²`\n\nFor this equation to be true for any arbitrary infinitesimal displacements `dφ` and `dλ`, the terms involving `dφ²` must be equal on both sides, and the terms involving `dλ²` must also be equal on both sides.\n\n**Step 6: Derive two equations by comparing the coefficients of the differentials.**\nBy equating the coefficients of `dλ²` from both sides of the equation in Step 5, we obtain our first equation:\nEquation 1: `R² = Ω²(φ) R² cos²(φ)`\n\nBy equating the coefficients of `dφ²` from both sides, we obtain our second equation:\nEquation 2: `(y'(φ))² = Ω²(φ) R²`\n\n**Step 7: Solve the system of equations to find an expression for y'(φ).**\nWe begin by solving Equation 1 for the scaling factor `Ω²(φ)`. Assuming the radius `R` is non-zero (`R ≠ 0`), we can divide both sides by `R²`:\n`1 = Ω²(φ) cos²(φ)`\n\nTo isolate `Ω²(φ)`, we divide by `cos²(φ)`. This is permissible for all latitudes except the poles (`φ ≠ ±π/2`), where `cos(φ) = 0`.\n`Ω²(φ) = 1 / cos²(φ) = sec²(φ)`\n\nNow, we substitute this result for `Ω²(φ)` into Equation 2:\n`(y'(φ))² = (sec²(φ)) R²`\n\nTo find `y'(φ)`, we take the square root of both sides:\n`y'(φ) = ±√(R² sec²(φ))`\n`y'(φ) = ±|R sec(φ)|`\n\nBy convention for the Mercator projection, we choose the positive sign so that increasing latitude corresponds to an increasing y-coordinate. Furthermore, for the typical domain of the map, `-π/2 < φ < π/2`, the cosine function is positive, so `sec(φ)` is also positive. Thus, we can remove the absolute value signs:\n`y'(φ) = R sec(φ)`\n\nThis completes the derivation outlined by the provided sub-strategy, yielding the differential equation that governs the vertical coordinate of the conformal projection.\n\n**Final Step: Integration to Solve the Original Problem**\nThe original problem is to find the integral of `sec(x)`. The sub-strategy has led to the differential equation `dy/dφ = R sec(φ)`. To find the function `y(φ)`, we must integrate its derivative:\n`y(φ) = ∫ (dy/dφ) dφ = ∫ R sec(φ) dφ = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\nSolving the original problem is equivalent to evaluating the integral `∫ sec(φ) dφ` (or `∫ sec(x) dx`, as the variable name is immaterial). Let us now compute this integral.\nThe standard technique involves multiplying the integrand by a factor of 1 in a specific form:\n`∫ sec(φ) dφ = ∫ sec(φ) * [ (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) ] dφ`\n\nDistributing `sec(φ)` in the numerator gives:\n`∫ [ sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ) ] / [ sec(φ) + tan(φ) ] dφ`\n\nWe now use the method of substitution. Let `u = sec(φ) + tan(φ)`.\nWe find the differential `du` by differentiating `u` with respect to `φ`:\n`du/dφ = d/dφ(sec(φ) + tan(φ)) = d/dφ(sec(φ)) + d/dφ(tan(φ))`\nThe derivatives are:\n`d/dφ(sec(φ)) = sec(φ)tan(φ)`\n`d/dφ(tan(φ)) = sec²(φ)`\nSo, `du/dφ = sec(φ)tan(φ) + sec²(φ)`.\nThis means `du = (sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ)) dφ`.\n\nWe observe that the numerator of our integral is precisely `du` and the denominator is `u`. Substituting these into the integral:\n`∫ (1/u) du`\n\nThis is a standard integral form, which evaluates to:\n`ln|u| + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for `u`:\n`ln|sec(φ) + tan(φ)| + C`\n\nReplacing the dummy variable `φ` with the variable `x` from the original problem statement, we arrive at the final, definitive answer.\n\nThe integral of sec(x) is:\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`",

The projection is defined as:\\n`x = Rλ`\\n`y = y(φ)`\\nwhere `y(φ)` is a function of latitude to be determined.\\n\\nWe now compute the squared infinitesimal distance on the image plane, `d(image)²`, which is given by the standard Euclidean metric `dx² + dy²`.\\nFirst, we find the differentials `dx` and `dy` in terms of `dφ` and `dλ` using the chain rule:\\n`dx = (∂x/∂λ) dλ + (∂x/∂φ) dφ = R dλ + 0 dφ = R dλ`\\n`dy = (∂y/∂λ) dλ + (∂y/∂φ) dφ = 0 dλ + y'(φ) dφ = y'(φ) dφ`\\nwhere `y'(φ)` denotes `dy/dφ`.\\n\\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for the squared distance on the image:\\n`d(image)² = dx² + dy² = (R dλ)² + (y'(φ) dφ)²`\\n`d(image)² = R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ²`\\n\\n**Step 3: Impose the condition of conformality.**\\nA map is conformal if it preserves angles. A consequence of this is that the scaling of length at any given point is isotropic, meaning it is the same in all directions. This implies that an infinitesimal circle on the original surface must be mapped to an infinitesimal circle on the image surface.\\n\\n**Step 4: Formalize the conformal condition using a scaling factor.**\\nThe condition of isotropic scaling requires that the ratio of the squared distance on the image, `d(image)²`, to the squared distance on the sphere, `ds²`, must be a scaling factor that depends only on the position `(φ, λ)`, and not on the direction of the displacement (i.e., not on the ratio of `dφ` to `dλ`). We denote this squared scaling factor as `Ω²`. Given that the projection's y-component depends only on `φ` and the x-component depends linearly on `λ`, the scaling factor can only be a function of `φ`. Thus, we write `Ω²(φ)`.\\nThe formal condition is:\\n`d(image)² / ds² = Ω²(φ)`\\n\\n**Step 5: Set up the equation for coefficient comparison.**\\nWe substitute the expressions for `d(image)²` (from Step 2) and `ds²` (from Step 1) into the conformality equation from Step 4:\\n`[R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ²] / [R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)] = Ω²(φ)`\\n\\nTo facilitate the comparison of coefficients, we rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator:\\n`R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ² = Ω²(φ) * [R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)]`\\nDistributing `Ω²(φ)R²` on the right-hand side yields:\\n`R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ² = Ω²(φ) R² dφ² + Ω²(φ) R² cos²(φ) dλ²`\\n\\nFor this equation to be true for any arbitrary infinitesimal displacements `dφ` and `dλ`, the terms involving `dφ²` must be equal on both sides, and the terms involving `dλ²` must also be equal on both sides.\\n\\n**Step 6: Derive two equations by comparing the coefficients of the differentials.**\\nBy equating the coefficients of `dλ²` from both sides of the equation in Step 5, we obtain our first equation:\\nEquation 1: `R² = Ω²(φ) R² cos²(φ)`\\n\\nBy equating the coefficients of `dφ²` from both sides, we obtain our second equation:\\nEquation 2: `(y'(φ))² = Ω²(φ) R²`\\n\\n**Step 7: Solve the system of equations to find an expression for y'(φ).**\\nWe begin by solving Equation 1 for the scaling factor `Ω²(φ)`. Assuming the radius `R` is non-zero (`R ≠ 0`), we can divide both sides by `R²`:\\n`1 = Ω²(φ) cos²(φ)`\\n\\nTo isolate `Ω²(φ)`, we divide by `cos²(φ)`. This is permissible for all latitudes except the poles (`φ ≠ ±π/2`), where `cos(φ) = 0`.\\n`Ω²(φ) = 1 / cos²(φ) = sec²(φ)`\\n\\nNow, we substitute this result for `Ω²(φ)` into Equation 2:\\n`(y'(φ))² = (sec²(φ)) R²`\\n\\nTo find `y'(φ)`, we take the square root of both sides:\\n`y'(φ) = ±√(R² sec²(φ))`\\n`y'(φ) = ±|R sec(φ)|`\\n\\nBy convention for the Mercator projection, we choose the positive sign so that increasing latitude corresponds to an increasing y-coordinate. Furthermore, for the typical domain of the map, `-π/2 < φ < π/2`, the cosine function is positive, so `sec(φ)` is also positive. Thus, we can remove the absolute value signs:\\n`y'(φ) = R sec(φ)`\\n\\nThis completes the derivation outlined by the provided sub-strategy, yielding the differential equation that governs the vertical coordinate of the conformal projection.\\n\\n**Final Step: Integration to Solve the Original Problem**\\nThe original problem is to find the integral of `sec(x)`. The sub-strategy has led to the differential equation `dy/dφ = R sec(φ)`. To find the function `y(φ)`, we must integrate its derivative:\\n`y(φ) = ∫ (dy/dφ) dφ = ∫ R sec(φ) dφ = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\\n\\nSolving the original problem is equivalent to evaluating the integral `∫ sec(φ) dφ` (or `∫ sec(x) dx`, as the variable name is immaterial). Let us now compute this integral.\\nThe standard technique involves multiplying the integrand by a factor of 1 in a specific form:\\n`∫ sec(φ) dφ = ∫ sec(φ) * [ (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) ] dφ`\\n\\nDistributing `sec(φ)` in the numerator gives:\\n`∫ [ sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ) ] / [ sec(φ) + tan(φ) ] dφ`\\n\\nWe now use the method of substitution. Let `u = sec(φ) + tan(φ)`.\\nWe find the differential `du` by differentiating `u` with respect to `φ`:\\n`du/dφ = d/dφ(sec(φ) + tan(φ)) = d/dφ(sec(φ)) + d/dφ(tan(φ))`\\nThe derivatives are:\\n`d/dφ(sec(φ)) = sec(φ)tan(φ)`\\n`d/dφ(tan(φ)) = sec²(φ)`\\nSo, `du/dφ = sec(φ)tan(φ) + sec²(φ)`.\\nThis means `du = (sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ)) dφ`.\\n\\nWe observe that the numerator of our integral is precisely `du` and the denominator is `u`. Substituting these into the integral:\\n`∫ (1/u) du`\\n\\nThis is a standard integral form, which evaluates to:\\n`ln|u| + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration.\\n\\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for `u`:\\n`ln|sec(φ) + tan(φ)| + C`\\n\\nReplacing the dummy variable `φ` with the variable `x` from the original problem statement, we arrive at the final, definitive answer.\\n\\nThe integral of sec(x) is:\\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The chosen solution, ID main1-sub3, is superior because it is the only submission that correctly, rigorously, and completely solves the problem by precisely adhering to the specified 'Conformal Geometric Derivation' strategy.

As per the sub-strategy, we define a substitution `t = tan(x/2)`.\n\n1.2. We construct a right-angled triangle. Let one of the non-right angles be `α = x/2`.\n\n1.3. The definition of the tangent function is `tan(α) = opposite / adjacent`. We set `tan(x/2) = t`, which can be written as `t/1`.\n\n1.4. We assign lengths to the sides of the triangle based on this ratio:\n    *   The side **opposite** to the angle `x/2` has length `t`.\n    *   The side **adjacent** to the angle `x/2` has length `1`.\n\n1.5. We use the Pythagorean theorem (`a² + b² = c²`) to find the length of the hypotenuse.\n    *   `hypotenuse² = (opposite)² + (adjacent)²`\n    *   `hypotenuse² = t² + 1²`\n    *   `hypotenuse² = 1 + t²`\n    *   `hypotenuse = sqrt(1 + t²)`. (Length must be positive).\n\n1.6. From this geometric model, we read off the sine and cosine of the angle `x/2` in terms of `t`:\n    *   `sin(x/2) = opposite / hypotenuse = t / sqrt(1 + t²)`.\n    *   `cos(x/2) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²)`.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of `sec(x)` in Terms of `t`**\n\n2.1. The sub-strategy requires using the double-angle identities to express `sin(x)` and `cos(x)` in terms of `t`.\n    *   The double-angle identity for sine is `sin(x) = 2 * sin(x/2) * cos(x/2)`.\n    *   The double-angle identity for cosine is `cos(x) = cos²(x/2) - sin²(x/2)`.\n\n2.2. Substitute the expressions for `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)` from Step 1.6 into the identity for `cos(x)`:\n    *   `cos(x) = (1 / sqrt(1 + t²))² - (t / sqrt(1 + t²))²`\n    *   `cos(x) = 1 / (1 + t²) - t² / (1 + t²)`\n    *   `cos(x) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²)`.\n\n2.3.

The sub-strategy requires differentiating `x = 2 * arctan(t)` to find `dx`. We start with our substitution `t = tan(x/2)`.\n\n3.2. We solve for `x`:\n    *   `arctan(t) = x/2`\n    *   `x = 2 * arctan(t)`.\n\n3.3. We differentiate `x` with respect to `t` to find `dx/dt`:\n    *   `dx/dt = d/dt (2 * arctan(t))`\n    *   Recalling the standard derivative `d/dt(arctan(t)) = 1 / (1 + t²)`, we have:\n    *   `dx/dt = 2 * (1 / (1 + t²)) = 2 / (1 + t²)`.\n\n3.4. We express `dx` in terms of `dt`:\n    *   `dx = (2 / (1 + t²)) dt`.\n\n**Step 4: Substitution into the Original Integral**\n\n4.1. The original integral is `∫ sec(x) dx`.\n\n4.2. We substitute the expression for `sec(x)` from Step 2.3 and the expression for `dx` from Step 3.4:\n    *   `∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [(1 + t²) / (1 - t²)] * [(2 / (1 + t²)) dt]`.\n\n4.3. We simplify the resulting integrand:\n    *   The term `(1 + t²)` in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the term `(1 + t²)` in the denominator of the second fraction.\n    *   `∫ (1 / (1 - t²)) * 2 dt = ∫ 2 / (1 - t²) dt`.\n    *   The integral is now a rational function in `t`, as predicted by the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 5: Solving the Integral in `t` using Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\n5.1. The sub-strategy specifies using partial fraction decomposition for `2 / (1 - t²)`.\n\n5.2. Factor the denominator, which is a difference of squares: `1 - t² = (1 - t)(1 + t)`.\n\n5.3. Set up the partial fraction form:\n    *   `2 / ((1 - t)(1 + t)) = A / (1 - t) + B / (1 + t)`.\n\n5.4. To solve for the constants `A` and `B`, we multiply both sides by the denominator `(1 - t)(1 + t)`:\n    *   `2 = A(1 + t) + B(1 - t)`.\n\n5.5. We find `A` and `B` by substituting strategic values for `t`:\n    *   Let `t = 1`: `2 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)  =>  2 = 2A + 0  =>  A = 1`.\n    *   Let `t = -1`: `2 = A(1 - 1) + B(1 - (-1))  =>  2 = 0 + 2B  =>  B = 1`.\n\n5.6. With `A = 1` and `B = 1`, the decomposed integral is:\n    *   `∫ (1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)) dt`.\n\n5.7. We integrate term by term:\n    *   `∫ 1 / (1 + t) dt + ∫ 1 / (1 - t) dt`.\n\n5.8. These are standard logarithmic integrals:\n    *   `∫ 1 / (1 + t) dt = ln|1 + t|`.\n    *   `∫ 1 / (1 - t) dt = -ln|1 - t|`. (This requires a u-substitution `u = 1-t`, `du = -dt`).\n\n5.9. Combining the terms and adding the constant of integration `C`:\n    *   Result in `t` = `ln|1 + t| - ln|1 - t| + C`.\n\n5.10. Using the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we simplify the expression:\n    *   Result in `t` = `ln|(1 + t) / (1 - t)| + C`.\n\n**Step 6: Back-Substitution and Final Simplification**\n\n6.1. We substitute `t = tan(x/2)` back into the result from Step 5.10:\n    *   `∫ sec(x) dx = ln|(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2))| + C`.\n\n6.2. To arrive at the fully simplified, standard form of the answer, we simplify the argument of the logarithm. We will show that `(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2))` is equal to `sec(x) + tan(x)`.\n    *   Recall the half-angle identity for tangent: `tan(x/2) = sin(x) / (1 + cos(x))`.\n    *   Substitute this into our expression:\n        `1 + tan(x/2) = 1 + sin(x) / (1 + cos(x)) = (1 + cos(x) + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))`.\n        `1 - tan(x/2) = 1 - sin(x) / (1 + cos(x)) = (1 + cos(x) - sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))`.\n    *   Now form the ratio:\n        `(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) = [(1 + cos(x) + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))] / [(1 + cos(x) - sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))]`\n        `= (1 + sin(x) + cos(x)) / (1 - sin(x) + cos(x))`.\n    *   Multiply the numerator and denominator by `(1 + sin(x) - cos(x))`:\n        `Num: (1 + (sin(x) + cos(x))) * (1 - (cos(x) - sin(x))) = (1 + sin(x) + cos(x)) * (1 - cos(x) + sin(x))`\n        `= ((1 + sin(x)) + cos(x)) * ((1 + sin(x)) - cos(x)) = (1 + sin(x))² - cos²(x)`\n        `= 1 + 2sin(x) + sin²(x) - cos²(x) = 1 + 2sin(x) + sin²(x) - (1 - sin²(x))`\n        `= 1 + 2sin(x) + sin²(x) - 1 + sin²(x) = 2sin(x) + 2sin²(x) = 2sin(x)(1 + sin(x))`.\n        `Den: (1 + cos(x) - sin(x)) * (1 - cos(x) + sin(x)) = ((1 + sin(x)) - cos(x)) * ((1 - sin(x)) + cos(x))`. This is getting complicated. Let's use the other identities derived in Step 2.\n    *   Alternative simplification:\n        `sec(x) + tan(x) = [(1 + t²) / (1 - t²)] + [2t / (1 - t²)]`\n        where `tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x) = [(2t)/(1+t²)] / [(1-t²)/(1+t²)] = 2t/(1-t²)`.\n        `sec(x) + tan(x) = (1 + t² + 2t) / (1 - t²) = (1 + t)² / ((1 - t)(1 + t))`.\n    *   Assuming `1 + t ≠ 0` (which corresponds to `tan(x/2) ≠ -1`, or `x/2 ≠ -π/4 + kπ`), we can cancel one factor of `(1 + t)`:\n        `sec(x) + tan(x) = (1 + t) / (1 - t)`.\n\n6.3. This algebraic identity proves that `(1 + t) / (1 - t)` is equivalent to `sec(x) + tan(x)`. Therefore, we can write the final answer in its most common and simplified form.\n    *   `ln|(1 + t) / (1 - t)| + C = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe definitive and fully simplified solution, derived by rigorously following the provided sub-strategy, is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

This plan utilizes complex analysis to establish the substitution formulas. Start with `t = tan(x/2)` and express `tan(x/2)` using the complex exponential definitions of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)` derived from Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`. Let `z = e^(ix/2)` and manipulate the resulting equation to solve for `z^2` (which is `e^(ix)`) as a rational function of `t`. Equate this expression for `e^(ix)` with its definition, `cos(x) + i*sin(x)`. Rationalize the complex rational function of `t` by multiplying by its conjugate, then equate the real and imaginary parts of the resulting equation to obtain expressions for `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`. From `cos(x)`, find `sec(x)`. Then, find `dx` by differentiating `x = 2*arctan(t)`. Substitute these formulas into the integral, solve the resulting rational integral in `t` using standard methods like partial fractions, and perform the final back-substitution to state the result in terms of `x`.\n\n**Execution of the Sub-Strategy:**\n\n**Step 1: Express `tan(x/2)` using complex exponentials.**\nThe sub-strategy begins by defining `t = tan(x/2)`. We will express this using the complex exponential forms of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)`.\n\nFrom Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`, we derive the definitions for cosine and sine:\n`cos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ)) / 2`\n`sin(θ) = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) / (2i)`\n\nApplying these for `θ = x/2`:\n`cos(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2`\n`sin(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i)`\n\nNow, we express `t = tan(x/2)`:\n`t = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2) = [ (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i) ] / [ (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2 ]`\n`t = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (i * (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)))`\n\n**Step 2: Solve for `e^(ix)` in terms of `t`.**\nLet `z = e^(ix/2)`, as per the sub-strategy. Then `z⁻¹ = e^(-ix/2)`. Substituting `z` into the expression for `t`:\n`t = (z - z⁻¹) / (i * (z + z⁻¹))`\n\nTo clear the complex fractions, we multiply the numerator and denominator inside the main fraction by `z`:\n`t = (z * (z - 1/z)) / (z * i * (z + 1/z))`\n`t = (z² - 1) / (i * (z² + 1))`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `z²`:\n`i * t * (z² + 1) = z² - 1`\n`i*t*z² + i*t = z² - 1`\n`1 + i*t = z² - i*t*z²`\n`1 + i*t = z² * (1 - i*t)`\n`z² = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nSince `z = e^(ix/2)`, we have `z² = (e^(ix/2))² = e^(ix)`. Therefore:\n`e^(ix) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\n**Step 3: Derive `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`.**\nWe equate the definition `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)` with the expression derived in the previous step:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts, we rationalize the right-hand side by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is `(1 + i*t)`:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = [ (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t) ] * [ (1 + i*t) / (1 + i*t) ]`\n\nNumerator: `(1 + i*t)² = 1² + 2(1)(i*t) + (i*t)² = 1 + 2it + i²t² = 1 + 2it - t² = (1 - t²) + i(2t)`\nDenominator: `(1 - i*t)(1 + i*t) = 1² - (i*t)² = 1 - i²t² = 1 - (-1)t² = 1 + t²`\n\nSubstituting these back:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = ( (1 - t²) + i(2t) ) / (1 + t²) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) + i * (2t / (1 + t²))`\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts of this equation, we obtain the required formulas:\nReal part: `cos(x) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²)`\nImaginary part: `sin(x) = 2t / (1 + t²)`\n\n**Step 4: Derive expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` in terms of `t`.**\nFirst, for `sec(x)`:\n`sec(x) = 1 / cos(x) = 1 / [ (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) ] = (1 + t²) / (1 - t²)`\n\nNext, for `dx`, we start from `t = tan(x/2)`, which implies `x = 2*arctan(t)`. We differentiate `x` with respect to `t`:\n`dx/dt = d/dt [2*arctan(t)]`\nUsing the standard derivative `d/du[arctan(u)] = 1 / (1 + u²)`, we get:\n`dx/dt = 2 * (1 / (1 + t²)) = 2 / (1 + t²)`\nFrom this, we solve for the differential `dx`:\n`dx = (2 / (1 + t²)) dt`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute into the integral and solve.**\nWe substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` into the original integral `∫ sec(x) dx`:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ (1 + t²) / (1 - t²) ] * [ (2 / (1 + t²)) dt ]`\n\nThe `(1 + t²)` term in the numerator cancels with the `(1 + t²)` term in the denominator:\n`∫ (2 / (1 - t²)) dt`\n\nThe sub-strategy specifies using partial fractions. We decompose the integrand `2 / (1 - t²)`. First, factor the denominator: `1 - t² = (1 - t)(1 + t)`.\nThe partial fraction decomposition is of the form:\n`2 / ((1 - t)(1 + t)) = A / (1 - t) + B / (1 + t)`\n\nTo find the coefficients `A` and `B`, we multiply both sides by the denominator `(1 - t)(1 + t)`:\n`2 = A(1 + t) + B(1 - t)`\n\nWe solve for `A` by setting `t = 1`:\n`2 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)  =>  2 = 2A  =>  A = 1`\n\nWe solve for `B` by setting `t = -1`:\n`2 = A(1 - 1) + B(1 - (-1))  =>  2 = 2B  =>  B = 1`\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n`∫ (1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)) dt`\n`= ∫ 1/(1 + t) dt + ∫ 1/(1 - t) dt`\n\nWe integrate each term:\n`∫ 1/(1 + t) dt = ln|1 + t|`\n`∫ 1/(1 - t) dt = -ln|1 - t|` (using a u-substitution `u = 1 - t`, `du = -dt`)\n\nCombining the results, we have:\n`ln|1 + t| - ln|1 - t| + C`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\n`ln| (1 + t) / (1 - t) | + C`\n\n**Step 6: Back-substitute and simplify to final form.**\nFinally, we substitute `t = tan(x/2)` back into the result:\n`ln| (1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) | + C`\n\nTo achieve the fully simplified, standard form of the answer, we simplify the argument of the logarithm. We substitute `tan(x/2) = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2)`:\n` (1 + sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) / (1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) `\n`= [ (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ] / [ (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ]`\n`= (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))`\n\nTo simplify further, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`:\nNumerator: `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))² = cos²(x/2) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + sin²(x/2)`\nUsing the identities `cos²(θ) + sin²(θ) = 1` and `2sin(θ)cos(θ) = sin(2θ)`, the numerator becomes `1 + sin(2 * x/2) = 1 + sin(x)`.\n\nDenominator: `(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) = cos²(x/2) - sin²(x/2)`\nUsing the identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, the denominator becomes `cos(2 * x/2) = cos(x)`.\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n`(1 + sin(x)) / cos(x) = 1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`\n\nSubstituting this simplified expression back into the logarithmic result gives the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe definitive, fully simplified result of the integration is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

We can construct such a triangle where the side opposite to angle `B` is `t` and the side adjacent to angle `B` is `1`.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, `hypotenuse^2 = opposite^2 + adjacent^2`.\n`hypotenuse^2 = t^2 + 1^2`\n`hypotenuse = sqrt(t^2 + 1)`\nNow we can find `sin(B)` and `cos(B)` from this triangle.\n`sin(B) = sin(arctan(t)) = opposite / hypotenuse = t / sqrt(t^2 + 1)`\n`cos(B) = cos(arctan(t)) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1 / sqrt(t^2 + 1)`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the expressions for sin(arctan(t)) and cos(arctan(t)) to find sec(x) in terms of t.**\nWe substitute these results back into the expression for `cos(2 * arctan(t))`:\n`cos(2 * arctan(t)) = cos^2(arctan(t)) - sin^2(arctan(t))`\n`cos(2 * arctan(t)) = (1 / sqrt(t^2 + 1))^2 - (t / sqrt(t^2 + 1))^2`\nSquaring the terms:\n`cos(2 * arctan(t)) = 1 / (t^2 + 1) - t^2 / (t^2 + 1)`\nCombining the fractions:\n`cos(2 * arctan(t)) = (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2)`\nNow we find `sec(x)` using `sec(x) = 1 / cos(x) = 1 / cos(2 * arctan(t))`.\n`sec(x) = 1 / [(1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2)]`\n`sec(x) = (1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)`\n\n**Step 6: Assemble and simplify the complete transformed integral.**\nThe original integral is `∫ sec(x) dx`. We substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` in terms of `t`.\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [(1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)] * [2 / (1 + t^2)] dt`\nThe term `(1 + t^2)` in the numerator cancels with the term `(1 + t^2)` in the denominator.\n`∫ [1 / (1 - t^2)] * [2 / 1] dt`\n`∫ 2 / (1 - t^2) dt`\n\n**Step 7: Integrate the resulting rational function with respect to t.**\nThe integral is `∫ 2 / (1 - t^2) dt`. We use partial fraction decomposition for the integrand `2 / (1 - t^2)`.\nThe denominator `1 - t^2` factors as `(1 - t)(1 + t)`.\n`2 / ((1 - t)(1 + t)) = A / (1 - t) + B / (1 + t)`\nTo find `A` and `B`, we multiply both sides by `(1 - t)(1 + t)`:\n`2 = A(1 + t) + B(1 - t)`\nTo solve for `A`, let `t = 1`:\n`2 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)`\n`2 = A(2) + B(0)`\n`2 = 2A`\n`A = 1`\nTo solve for `B`, let `t = -1`:\n`2 = A(1 + (-1)) + B(1 - (-1))`\n`2 = A(0) + B(2)`\n`2 = 2B`\n`B = 1`\nSo, the decomposition is `1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)`.\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ [1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)] dt = ∫ 1 / (1 - t) dt + ∫ 1 / (1 + t) dt`\nFor the first integral, `∫ 1/(1-t) dt`, let `u = 1 - t`, so `du = -dt`, or `dt = -du`. The integral is `∫ 1/u (-du) = -∫ 1/u du = -ln|u| = -ln|1 - t|`.\nFor the second integral, `∫ 1/(1+t) dt`, let `v = 1 + t`, so `dv = dt`. The integral is `∫ 1/v dv = ln|v| = ln|1 + t|`.\nCombining the results and adding the constant of integration `C`:\n`∫ 2 / (1 - t^2) dt = ln|1 + t| - ln|1 - t| + C`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\n`ln|(1 + t) / (1 - t)| + C`\n\n**Step 8: Back-substitute to express the result in terms of x.**\nWe substitute `t = tan(x/2)` back into the result.\nResult = `ln|(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2))| + C`\n\n**Step 9: Simplify the final answer to its standard form.**\nThe expression `(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2))` can be simplified. We write `tan(x/2)` as `sin(x/2) / cos(x/2)`.\n`(1 + sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) / (1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2))`\nMultiply the numerator and the denominator by `cos(x/2)` to clear the complex fractions:\n`[cos(x/2)(1 + sin(x/2)/cos(x/2))] / [cos(x/2)(1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2))]`\n`= [cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)] / [cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)]`\nTo simplify further, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`:\n`= [(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))] / [(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))]`\n`= [(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))^2] / [cos^2(x/2) - sin^2(x/2)]`\nThe numerator expands to `cos^2(x/2) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + sin^2(x/2)`. Using the identity `cos^2(A) + sin^2(A) = 1` and the double-angle identity `2sin(A)cos(A) = sin(2A)`, the numerator becomes `(cos^2(x/2) + sin^2(x/2)) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) = 1 + sin(2 * x/2) = 1 + sin(x)`.\nThe denominator is the double-angle identity for cosine, `cos^2(A) - sin^2(A) = cos(2A)`. So, `cos^2(x/2) - sin^2(x/2) = cos(2 * x/2) = cos(x)`.\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n`(1 + sin(x)) / cos(x)`\nWe can split this fraction:\n`1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`\nSubstituting this back into the logarithmic expression:\nFinal Answer = `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\nFinal, definitive, fully simplified, and unambiguous answer:\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

The derivative of `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|` is `sec(x)` on any interval where `sec(x)` is continuous.

The integral emerges as a necessary consequence of the geometric constraints. The steps are: 1. Model the Earth as a sphere with the standard Riemannian metric expressed in latitude (φ) and longitude (λ) coordinates: ds² = R²(dφ² + cos²(φ)dλ²). 2. Define a projection onto a cylinder where the cylindrical coordinates are x = Rλ and y = y(φ). The metric on the cylinder is ds² = dx² + dy². 3. Impose the condition of conformality, which requires that the metric pulled back from the cylinder to the sphere is a scalar multiple of the original sphere metric. This means f*(g_cyl) = Ω²(φ) * g_sphere. 4. By expressing the pullback metric in terms of y'(φ) and comparing the coefficients of the dλ² and dφ² terms in the two metrics, derive two equations. 5.

This strategy shifts the problem from the domain of continuous calculus to that of discrete infinite series. The approach is to operate on the power series representation of the function rather than the function itself. The process is: 1. Derive the Maclaurin series for sec(x). This requires finding a general formula for the nth derivative of sec(x) at x=0, which involves the Euler numbers (E_n), leading to a power series of the form Σ a_n * x^(2n). 2. Apply the principle of term-by-term integration to this power series, which is valid within its radius of convergence. This involves applying the power rule for integration to each term, generating a new series of the form C + Σ [a_n / (2n+1)] * x^(2n+1). 3. The crucial and most complex step is to perform 'series recognition': identify the function that this newly generated power series represents. 4. This requires independently deriving the Maclaurin series for the candidate solution function, ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), by computing its successive derivatives and establishing a pattern. 5. The final step is to prove the identity of the two series by showing that the coefficients of the integrated secant series match the coefficients of the series for ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), thereby confirming the integral's solution through the machinery of infinite series.\n\nYour mission as 'Strategem Decomposer Maxima': Devise 4 **ENTIRELY NOVEL, UNIQUE, FULLY INDEPENDENT, and SELF-CONTAINED mini-plans (sub-strategies)**.

This involves applying the power rule for integration to each term, generating a new series of the form C + Σ [a_n / (2n+1)] * x^(2n+1). 3. The crucial and most complex step is to perform 'series recognition': identify the function that this newly generated power series represents. 4. This requires independently deriving the Maclaurin series for the candidate solution function, ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), by computing its successive derivatives and establishing a pattern. 5. The final step is to prove the identity of the two series by showing that the coefficients of the integrated secant series match the coefficients of the series for ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), thereby confirming the integral's solution through the machinery of infinite series.\".

Your task is:\n1.  Critically analyze each solution for correctness, rigor, clarity, and elegance.\n2.

As per the sub-strategy, we define a substitution `t = tan(x/2)`.\n\n1.2. We construct a right-angled triangle. Let one of the non-right angles be `α = x/2`.\n\n1.3. The definition of the tangent function is `tan(α) = opposite / adjacent`. We set `tan(x/2) = t`, which can be written as `t/1`.\n\n1.4. We assign lengths to the sides of the triangle based on this ratio:\n    *   The side **opposite** to the angle `x/2` has length `t`.\n    *   The side **adjacent** to the angle `x/2` has length `1`.\n\n1.5. We use the Pythagorean theorem (`a² + b² = c²`) to find the length of the hypotenuse.\n    *   `hypotenuse² = (opposite)² + (adjacent)²`\n    *   `hypotenuse² = t² + 1²`\n    *   `hypotenuse² = 1 + t²`\n    *   `hypotenuse = sqrt(1 + t²)`. (Length must be positive).\n\n1.6. From this geometric model, we read off the sine and cosine of the angle `x/2` in terms of `t`:\n    *   `sin(x/2) = opposite / hypotenuse = t / sqrt(1 + t²)`.\n    *   `cos(x/2) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²)`.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of `sec(x)` in Terms of `t`**\n\n2.1. The sub-strategy requires using the double-angle identities to express `sin(x)` and `cos(x)` in terms of `t`.\n    *   The double-angle identity for sine is `sin(x) = 2 * sin(x/2) * cos(x/2)`.\n    *   The double-angle identity for cosine is `cos(x) = cos²(x/2) - sin²(x/2)`.\n\n2.2. Substitute the expressions for `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)` from Step 1.6 into the identity for `cos(x)`:\n    *   `cos(x) = (1 / sqrt(1 + t²))² - (t / sqrt(1 + t²))²`\n    *   `cos(x) = 1 / (1 + t²) - t² / (1 + t²)`\n    *   `cos(x) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²)`.\n\n2.3. The function `sec(x)` is the reciprocal of `cos(x)`. We invert the expression for `cos(x)`:\n    *   `sec(x) = 1 / cos(x) = 1 / ((1 - t²) / (1 + t²))`\n    *   `sec(x) = (1 + t²) / (1 - t²)`.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of `dx` in Terms of `dt`**\n\n3.1. The sub-strategy requires differentiating `x = 2 * arctan(t)` to find `dx`. We start with our substitution `t = tan(x/2)`.\n\n3.2. We solve for `x`:\n    *   `arctan(t) = x/2`\n    *   `x = 2 * arctan(t)`.\n\n3.3. We differentiate `x` with respect to `t` to find `dx/dt`:\n    *   `dx/dt = d/dt (2 * arctan(t))`\n    *   Recalling the standard derivative `d/dt(arctan(t)) = 1 / (1 + t²)`, we have:\n    *   `dx/dt = 2 * (1 / (1 + t²)) = 2 / (1 + t²)`.\n\n3.4. We express `dx` in terms of `dt`:\n    *   `dx = (2 / (1 + t²)) dt`.\n\n**Step 4: Substitution into the Original Integral**\n\n4.1. The original integral is `∫ sec(x) dx`.\n\n4.2. We substitute the expression for `sec(x)` from Step 2.3 and the expression for `dx` from Step 3.4:\n    *   `∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [(1 + t²) / (1 - t²)] * [(2 / (1 + t²)) dt]`.\n\n4.3. We simplify the resulting integrand:\n    *   The term `(1 + t²)` in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the term `(1 + t²)` in the denominator of the second fraction.\n    *   `∫ (1 / (1 - t²)) * 2 dt = ∫ 2 / (1 - t²) dt`.\n    *   The integral is now a rational function in `t`, as predicted by the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 5: Solving the Integral in `t` using Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\n5.1. The sub-strategy specifies using partial fraction decomposition for `2 / (1 - t²)`.\n\n5.2. Factor the denominator, which is a difference of squares: `1 - t² = (1 - t)(1 + t)`.\n\n5.3. Set up the partial fraction form:\n    *   `2 / ((1 - t)(1 + t)) = A / (1 - t) + B / (1 + t)`.\n\n5.4. To solve for the constants `A` and `B`, we multiply both sides by the denominator `(1 - t)(1 + t)`:\n    *   `2 = A(1 + t) + B(1 - t)`.\n\n5.5. We find `A` and `B` by substituting strategic values for `t`:\n    *   Let `t = 1`: `2 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)  =>  2 = 2A + 0  =>  A = 1`.\n    *   Let `t = -1`: `2 = A(1 - 1) + B(1 - (-1))  =>  2 = 0 + 2B  =>  B = 1`.\n\n5.6. With `A = 1` and `B = 1`, the decomposed integral is:\n    *   `∫ (1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)) dt`.\n\n5.7. We integrate term by term:\n    *   `∫ 1 / (1 + t) dt + ∫ 1 / (1 - t) dt`.\n\n5.8. These are standard logarithmic integrals:\n    *   `∫ 1 / (1 + t) dt = ln|1 + t|`.\n    *   `∫ 1 / (1 - t) dt = -ln|1 - t|`. (This requires a u-substitution `u = 1-t`, `du = -dt`).\n\n5.9. Combining the terms and adding the constant of integration `C`:\n    *   Result in `t` = `ln|1 + t| - ln|1 - t| + C`.\n\n5.10. Using the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we simplify the expression:\n    *   Result in `t` = `ln|(1 + t) / (1 - t)| + C`.\n\n**Step 6: Back-Substitution and Final Simplification**\n\n6.1. We substitute `t = tan(x/2)` back into the result from Step 5.10:\n    *   `∫ sec(x) dx = ln|(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2))| + C`.\n\n6.2. To arrive at the fully simplified, standard form of the answer, we simplify the argument of the logarithm. We will show that `(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2))` is equal to `sec(x) + tan(x)`.\n    *   Recall the half-angle identity for tangent: `tan(x/2) = sin(x) / (1 + cos(x))`.\n    *   Substitute this into our expression:\n        `1 + tan(x/2) = 1 + sin(x) / (1 + cos(x)) = (1 + cos(x) + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))`.\n        `1 - tan(x/2) = 1 - sin(x) / (1 + cos(x)) = (1 + cos(x) - sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))`.\n    *   Now form the ratio:\n        `(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) = [(1 + cos(x) + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))] / [(1 + cos(x) - sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))]`\n        `= (1 + sin(x) + cos(x)) / (1 - sin(x) + cos(x))`.\n    *   Multiply the numerator and denominator by `(1 + sin(x) - cos(x))`:\n        `Num: (1 + (sin(x) + cos(x))) * (1 - (cos(x) - sin(x))) = (1 + sin(x) + cos(x)) * (1 - cos(x) + sin(x))`\n        `= ((1 + sin(x)) + cos(x)) * ((1 + sin(x)) - cos(x)) = (1 + sin(x))² - cos²(x)`\n        `= 1 + 2sin(x) + sin²(x) - cos²(x) = 1 + 2sin(x) + sin²(x) - (1 - sin²(x))`\n        `= 1 + 2sin(x) + sin²(x) - 1 + sin²(x) = 2sin(x) + 2sin²(x) = 2sin(x)(1 + sin(x))`.\n        `Den: (1 + cos(x) - sin(x)) * (1 - cos(x) + sin(x)) = ((1 + sin(x)) - cos(x)) * ((1 - sin(x)) + cos(x))`. This is getting complicated. Let's use the other identities derived in Step 2.\n    *   Alternative simplification:\n        `sec(x) + tan(x) = [(1 + t²) / (1 - t²)] + [2t / (1 - t²)]`\n        where `tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x) = [(2t)/(1+t²)] / [(1-t²)/(1+t²)] = 2t/(1-t²)`.\n        `sec(x) + tan(x) = (1 + t² + 2t) / (1 - t²) = (1 + t)² / ((1 - t)(1 + t))`.\n    *   Assuming `1 + t ≠ 0` (which corresponds to `tan(x/2) ≠ -1`, or `x/2 ≠ -π/4 + kπ`), we can cancel one factor of `(1 + t)`:\n        `sec(x) + tan(x) = (1 + t) / (1 - t)`.\n\n6.3. This algebraic identity proves that `(1 + t) / (1 - t)` is equivalent to `sec(x) + tan(x)`. Therefore, we can write the final answer in its most common and simplified form.\n    *   `ln|(1 + t) / (1 - t)| + C = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe definitive and fully simplified solution, derived by rigorously following the provided sub-strategy, is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\n--- SOLUTION 2 (ID: main2-sub1) ---\n**Problem:** Calculate the integral of `sec(x)`.\n\n**Sub-Strategy:** Complex Exponential Derivation via Euler's Formula. This plan utilizes complex analysis to establish the substitution formulas. Start with `t = tan(x/2)` and express `tan(x/2)` using the complex exponential definitions of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)` derived from Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`. Let `z = e^(ix/2)` and manipulate the resulting equation to solve for `z^2` (which is `e^(ix)`) as a rational function of `t`. Equate this expression for `e^(ix)` with its definition, `cos(x) + i*sin(x)`. Rationalize the complex rational function of `t` by multiplying by its conjugate, then equate the real and imaginary parts of the resulting equation to obtain expressions for `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`. From `cos(x)`, find `sec(x)`. Then, find `dx` by differentiating `x = 2*arctan(t)`. Substitute these formulas into the integral, solve the resulting rational integral in `t` using standard methods like partial fractions, and perform the final back-substitution to state the result in terms of `x`.\n\n**Execution of the Sub-Strategy:**\n\n**Step 1: Express `tan(x/2)` using complex exponentials.**\nThe sub-strategy begins by defining `t = tan(x/2)`. We will express this using the complex exponential forms of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)`.\n\nFrom Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`, we derive the definitions for cosine and sine:\n`cos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ)) / 2`\n`sin(θ) = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) / (2i)`\n\nApplying these for `θ = x/2`:\n`cos(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2`\n`sin(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i)`\n\nNow, we express `t = tan(x/2)`:\n`t = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2) = [ (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i) ] / [ (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2 ]`\n`t = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (i * (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)))`\n\n**Step 2: Solve for `e^(ix)` in terms of `t`.**\nLet `z = e^(ix/2)`, as per the sub-strategy. Then `z⁻¹ = e^(-ix/2)`. Substituting `z` into the expression for `t`:\n`t = (z - z⁻¹) / (i * (z + z⁻¹))`\n\nTo clear the complex fractions, we multiply the numerator and denominator inside the main fraction by `z`:\n`t = (z * (z - 1/z)) / (z * i * (z + 1/z))`\n`t = (z² - 1) / (i * (z² + 1))`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `z²`:\n`i * t * (z² + 1) = z² - 1`\n`i*t*z² + i*t = z² - 1`\n`1 + i*t = z² - i*t*z²`\n`1 + i*t = z² * (1 - i*t)`\n`z² = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nSince `z = e^(ix/2)`, we have `z² = (e^(ix/2))² = e^(ix)`. Therefore:\n`e^(ix) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\n**Step 3: Derive `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`.**\nWe equate the definition `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)` with the expression derived in the previous step:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts, we rationalize the right-hand side by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is `(1 + i*t)`:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = [ (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t) ] * [ (1 + i*t) / (1 + i*t) ]`\n\nNumerator: `(1 + i*t)² = 1² + 2(1)(i*t) + (i*t)² = 1 + 2it + i²t² = 1 + 2it - t² = (1 - t²) + i(2t)`\nDenominator: `(1 - i*t)(1 + i*t) = 1² - (i*t)² = 1 - i²t² = 1 - (-1)t² = 1 + t²`\n\nSubstituting these back:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = ( (1 - t²) + i(2t) ) / (1 + t²) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) + i * (2t / (1 + t²))`\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts of this equation, we obtain the required formulas:\nReal part: `cos(x) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²)`\nImaginary part: `sin(x) = 2t / (1 + t²)`\n\n**Step 4: Derive expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` in terms of `t`.**\nFirst, for `sec(x)`:\n`sec(x) = 1 / cos(x) = 1 / [ (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) ] = (1 + t²) / (1 - t²)`\n\nNext, for `dx`, we start from `t = tan(x/2)`, which implies `x = 2*arctan(t)`. We differentiate `x` with respect to `t`:\n`dx/dt = d/dt [2*arctan(t)]`\nUsing the standard derivative `d/du[arctan(u)] = 1 / (1 + u²)`, we get:\n`dx/dt = 2 * (1 / (1 + t²)) = 2 / (1 + t²)`\nFrom this, we solve for the differential `dx`:\n`dx = (2 / (1 + t²)) dt`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute into the integral and solve.**\nWe substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` into the original integral `∫ sec(x) dx`:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ (1 + t²) / (1 - t²) ] * [ (2 / (1 + t²)) dt ]`\n\nThe `(1 + t²)` term in the numerator cancels with the `(1 + t²)` term in the denominator:\n`∫ (2 / (1 - t²)) dt`\n\nThe sub-strategy specifies using partial fractions. We decompose the integrand `2 / (1 - t²)`. First, factor the denominator: `1 - t² = (1 - t)(1 + t)`.\nThe partial fraction decomposition is of the form:\n`2 / ((1 - t)(1 + t)) = A / (1 - t) + B / (1 + t)`\n\nTo find the coefficients `A` and `B`, we multiply both sides by the denominator `(1 - t)(1 + t)`:\n`2 = A(1 + t) + B(1 - t)`\n\nWe solve for `A` by setting `t = 1`:\n`2 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)  =>  2 = 2A  =>  A = 1`\n\nWe solve for `B` by setting `t = -1`:\n`2 = A(1 - 1) + B(1 - (-1))  =>  2 = 2B  =>  B = 1`\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n`∫ (1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)) dt`\n`= ∫ 1/(1 + t) dt + ∫ 1/(1 - t) dt`\n\nWe integrate each term:\n`∫ 1/(1 + t) dt = ln|1 + t|`\n`∫ 1/(1 - t) dt = -ln|1 - t|` (using a u-substitution `u = 1 - t`, `du = -dt`)\n\nCombining the results, we have:\n`ln|1 + t| - ln|1 - t| + C`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\n`ln| (1 + t) / (1 - t) | + C`\n\n**Step 6: Back-substitute and simplify to final form.**\nFinally, we substitute `t = tan(x/2)` back into the result:\n`ln| (1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) | + C`\n\nTo achieve the fully simplified, standard form of the answer, we simplify the argument of the logarithm. We substitute `tan(x/2) = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2)`:\n` (1 + sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) / (1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) `\n`= [ (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ] / [ (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ]`\n`= (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))`\n\nTo simplify further, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`:\nNumerator: `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))² = cos²(x/2) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + sin²(x/2)`\nUsing the identities `cos²(θ) + sin²(θ) = 1` and `2sin(θ)cos(θ) = sin(2θ)`, the numerator becomes `1 + sin(2 * x/2) = 1 + sin(x)`.\n\nDenominator: `(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) = cos²(x/2) - sin²(x/2)`\nUsing the identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, the denominator becomes `cos(2 * x/2) = cos(x)`.\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n`(1 + sin(x)) / cos(x) = 1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`\n\nSubstituting this simplified expression back into the logarithmic result gives the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe definitive, fully simplified result of the integration is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\n--- SOLUTION 3 (ID: main2-sub2) ---\nThe problem is to find the integral of sec(x), denoted as ∫sec(x) dx. The specified sub-strategy will be followed with absolute precision.\n\n**Step 1: Define the substitution and find the inverse relationship.**\nThe sub-strategy begins with the substitution `t = tan(x/2)`.\nTo find the inverse relationship, we solve this equation for `x`.\n`t = tan(x/2)`\nApply the inverse tangent function (arctan) to both sides:\n`arctan(t) = arctan(tan(x/2))`\n`arctan(t) = x/2`\nMultiply by 2 to isolate `x`:\n`x = 2 * arctan(t)`\n\n**Step 2: Differentiate the inverse relationship to find the transformation for dx.**\nWe have the expression for `x` in terms of `t`: `x = 2 * arctan(t)`.\nWe differentiate `x` with respect to `t` to find `dx/dt`.\n`dx/dt = d/dt [2 * arctan(t)]`\nUsing the constant multiple rule for differentiation:\n`dx/dt = 2 * d/dt [arctan(t)]`\nThe derivative of `arctan(t)` with respect to `t` is `1 / (1 + t^2)`.\n`dx/dt = 2 * [1 / (1 + t^2)]`\n`dx/dt = 2 / (1 + t^2)`\nMultiplying by `dt`, we find the expression for the differential `dx`:\n`dx = [2 / (1 + t^2)] dt`\n\n**Step 3: Transform the integrand sec(x) into a function of t.**\nThe integrand is `sec(x)`. We substitute `x = 2 * arctan(t)` into this expression.\n`sec(x) = sec(2 * arctan(t))`\nWe use the reciprocal identity `sec(A) = 1/cos(A)`.\n`sec(2 * arctan(t)) = 1 / cos(2 * arctan(t))`\nNext, we apply the double-angle identity for cosine, `cos(2B) = cos^2(B) - sin^2(B)`, where `B = arctan(t)`.\n`cos(2 * arctan(t)) = cos^2(arctan(t)) - sin^2(arctan(t))`\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate cos(arctan(t)) and sin(arctan(t)) using a reference triangle.**\nLet `B = arctan(t)`. By definition, this means `tan(B) = t`. We can express `t` as `t/1`.\nIn a right-angled triangle, `tan(B) = opposite / adjacent`. We can construct such a triangle where the side opposite to angle `B` is `t` and the side adjacent to angle `B` is `1`.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, `hypotenuse^2 = opposite^2 + adjacent^2`.\n`hypotenuse^2 = t^2 + 1^2`\n`hypotenuse = sqrt(t^2 + 1)`\nNow we can find `sin(B)` and `cos(B)` from this triangle.\n`sin(B) = sin(arctan(t)) = opposite / hypotenuse = t / sqrt(t^2 + 1)`\n`cos(B) = cos(arctan(t)) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1 / sqrt(t^2 + 1)`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the expressions for sin(arctan(t)) and cos(arctan(t)) to find sec(x) in terms of t.**\nWe substitute these results back into the expression for `cos(2 * arctan(t))`:\n`cos(2 * arctan(t)) = cos^2(arctan(t)) - sin^2(arctan(t))`\n`cos(2 * arctan(t)) = (1 / sqrt(t^2 + 1))^2 - (t / sqrt(t^2 + 1))^2`\nSquaring the terms:\n`cos(2 * arctan(t)) = 1 / (t^2 + 1) - t^2 / (t^2 + 1)`\nCombining the fractions:\n`cos(2 * arctan(t)) = (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2)`\nNow we find `sec(x)` using `sec(x) = 1 / cos(x) = 1 / cos(2 * arctan(t))`.\n`sec(x) = 1 / [(1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2)]`\n`sec(x) = (1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)`\n\n**Step 6: Assemble and simplify the complete transformed integral.**\nThe original integral is `∫ sec(x) dx`. We substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` in terms of `t`.\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [(1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)] * [2 / (1 + t^2)] dt`\nThe term `(1 + t^2)` in the numerator cancels with the term `(1 + t^2)` in the denominator.\n`∫ [1 / (1 - t^2)] * [2 / 1] dt`\n`∫ 2 / (1 - t^2) dt`\n\n**Step 7: Integrate the resulting rational function with respect to t.**\nThe integral is `∫ 2 / (1 - t^2) dt`. We use partial fraction decomposition for the integrand `2 / (1 - t^2)`.\nThe denominator `1 - t^2` factors as `(1 - t)(1 + t)`.\n`2 / ((1 - t)(1 + t)) = A / (1 - t) + B / (1 + t)`\nTo find `A` and `B`, we multiply both sides by `(1 - t)(1 + t)`:\n`2 = A(1 + t) + B(1 - t)`\nTo solve for `A`, let `t = 1`:\n`2 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)`\n`2 = A(2) + B(0)`\n`2 = 2A`\n`A = 1`\nTo solve for `B`, let `t = -1`:\n`2 = A(1 + (-1)) + B(1 - (-1))`\n`2 = A(0) + B(2)`\n`2 = 2B`\n`B = 1`\nSo, the decomposition is `1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)`.\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ [1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)] dt = ∫ 1 / (1 - t) dt + ∫ 1 / (1 + t) dt`\nFor the first integral, `∫ 1/(1-t) dt`, let `u = 1 - t`, so `du = -dt`, or `dt = -du`. The integral is `∫ 1/u (-du) = -∫ 1/u du = -ln|u| = -ln|1 - t|`.\nFor the second integral, `∫ 1/(1+t) dt`, let `v = 1 + t`, so `dv = dt`. The integral is `∫ 1/v dv = ln|v| = ln|1 + t|`.\nCombining the results and adding the constant of integration `C`:\n`∫ 2 / (1 - t^2) dt = ln|1 + t| - ln|1 - t| + C`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\n`ln|(1 + t) / (1 - t)| + C`\n\n**Step 8: Back-substitute to express the result in terms of x.**\nWe substitute `t = tan(x/2)` back into the result.\nResult = `ln|(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2))| + C`\n\n**Step 9: Simplify the final answer to its standard form.**\nThe expression `(1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2))` can be simplified. We write `tan(x/2)` as `sin(x/2) / cos(x/2)`.\n`(1 + sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) / (1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2))`\nMultiply the numerator and the denominator by `cos(x/2)` to clear the complex fractions:\n`[cos(x/2)(1 + sin(x/2)/cos(x/2))] / [cos(x/2)(1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2))]`\n`= [cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)] / [cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)]`\nTo simplify further, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`:\n`= [(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))] / [(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))]`\n`= [(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))^2] / [cos^2(x/2) - sin^2(x/2)]`\nThe numerator expands to `cos^2(x/2) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + sin^2(x/2)`. Using the identity `cos^2(A) + sin^2(A) = 1` and the double-angle identity `2sin(A)cos(A) = sin(2A)`, the numerator becomes `(cos^2(x/2) + sin^2(x/2)) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) = 1 + sin(2 * x/2) = 1 + sin(x)`.\nThe denominator is the double-angle identity for cosine, `cos^2(A) - sin^2(A) = cos(2A)`. So, `cos^2(x/2) - sin^2(x/2) = cos(2 * x/2) = cos(x)`.\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n`(1 + sin(x)) / cos(x)`\nWe can split this fraction:\n`1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`\nSubstituting this back into the logarithmic expression:\nFinal Answer = `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\nFinal, definitive, fully simplified, and unambiguous answer:\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\n--- SOLUTION 4 (ID: main2-sub3) ---\nHere is the rigorous, step-by-step execution of the provided sub-strategy to calculate the integral of sec(x).\n\n**Problem:** Calculate ∫sec(x) dx.\n\n**Sub-Strategy:** Hyperbolic Tangent Intermediate Solution.\n\n**Step 1: Perform the Weierstrass Substitution.**\nThe objective is to transform the integral of sec(x) into a rational integral using the substitution `t = tan(x/2)`.\n\n*   **Define the substitution:**\n    Let `t = tan(x/2)`.\n\n*   **Derive `dx` in terms of `t` and `dt`:**\n    If `t = tan(x/2)`, then `x/2 = arctan(t)`, so `x = 2 * arctan(t)`.\n    Differentiating `x` with respect to `t`:\n    `dx/dt = d/dt [2 * arctan(t)] = 2 * [1 / (1 + t^2)]`.\n    Therefore, `dx = 2 dt / (1 + t^2)`.\n\n*   **Derive `sec(x)` in terms of `t`:**\n    We use the half-angle identity for cosine expressed in terms of `tan(x/2)`:\n    `cos(x) = [1 - tan^2(x/2)] / [1 + tan^2(x/2)]`.\n    Substituting `t = tan(x/2)`:\n    `cos(x) = (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2)`.\n    Since `sec(x) = 1 / cos(x)`, we have:\n    `sec(x) = 1 / [(1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2)] = (1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)`.\n\n*   **Substitute into the integral:**\n    Let `I = ∫sec(x) dx`.\n    Substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx`:\n    `I = ∫ [(1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)] * [2 dt / (1 + t^2)]`.\n    The `(1 + t^2)` term in the numerator cancels with the `(1 + t^2)` term in the denominator.\n    `I = ∫ 2 / (1 - t^2) dt`.\n    This completes the transformation into a rational integral as per the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 2: Integrate using the Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent.**\nThe sub-strategy instructs to integrate the resulting form directly using the known antiderivative `∫ du / (1 - u^2) = arctanh(u)`.\n\n*   **Prepare the integral:**\n    `I = ∫ 2 / (1 - t^2) dt = 2 ∫ 1 / (1 - t^2) dt`.\n\n*   **Apply the `arctanh` antiderivative formula:**\n    Using the formula `∫ du / (1 - u^2) = arctanh(u) + C`, with `u = t`:\n    `I = 2 * arctanh(t) + C`.\n    Note: This formula is valid for the domain `|t| < 1`.

This plan utilizes complex analysis to establish the substitution formulas. Start with `t = tan(x/2)` and express `tan(x/2)` using the complex exponential definitions of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)` derived from Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`. Let `z = e^(ix/2)` and manipulate the resulting equation to solve for `z^2` (which is `e^(ix)`) as a rational function of `t`. Equate this expression for `e^(ix)` with its definition, `cos(x) + i*sin(x)`. Rationalize the complex rational function of `t` by multiplying by its conjugate, then equate the real and imaginary parts of the resulting equation to obtain expressions for `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`. From `cos(x)`, find `sec(x)`. Then, find `dx` by differentiating `x = 2*arctan(t)`. Substitute these formulas into the integral, solve the resulting rational integral in `t` using standard methods like partial fractions, and perform the final back-substitution to state the result in terms of `x`.\\n\\nExecution of the Sub-Strategy:\\n\\nStep 1: Express `tan(x/2)` using complex exponentials.\\nThe sub-strategy begins by defining `t = tan(x/2)`. We will express this using the complex exponential forms of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)`.\\n\\nFrom Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`, we derive the definitions for cosine and sine:\\n`cos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ)) / 2`\\n`sin(θ) = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) / (2i)`\\n\\nApplying these for `θ = x/2`:\\n`cos(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2`\\n`sin(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i)`\\n\\nNow, we express `t = tan(x/2)`:\\n`t = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2) = [ (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i) ] / [ (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2 ]`\\n`t = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (i * (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)))`\\n\\nStep 2: Solve for `e^(ix)` in terms of `t`.\\nLet `z = e^(ix/2)`, as per the sub-strategy. Then `z⁻¹ = e^(-ix/2)`. Substituting `z` into the expression for `t`:\\n`t = (z - z⁻¹) / (i * (z + z⁻¹))`\\n\\nTo clear the complex fractions, we multiply the numerator and denominator inside the main fraction by `z`:\\n`t = (z * (z - 1/z)) / (z * i * (z + 1/z))`\\n`t = (z² - 1) / (i * (z² + 1))`\\n\\nNow, we solve this equation for `z²`:\\n`i * t * (z² + 1) = z² - 1`\\n`i*t*z² + i*t = z² - 1`\\n`1 + i*t = z² - i*t*z²`\\n`1 + i*t = z² * (1 - i*t)`\\n`z² = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\\n\\nSince `z = e^(ix/2)`, we have `z² = (e^(ix/2))² = e^(ix)`. Therefore:\\n`e^(ix) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\\n\\nStep 3: Derive `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`.\\nWe equate the definition `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)` with the expression derived in the previous step:\\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\\n\\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts, we rationalize the right-hand side by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is `(1 + i*t)`:\\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = [ (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t) ] * [ (1 + i*t) / (1 + i*t) ]`\\n\\nNumerator: `(1 + i*t)² = 1² + 2(1)(i*t) + (i*t)² = 1 + 2it + i²t² = 1 + 2it - t² = (1 - t²) + i(2t)`\\nDenominator: `(1 - i*t)(1 + i*t) = 1² - (i*t)² = 1 - i²t² = 1 - (-1)t² = 1 + t²`\\n\\nSubstituting these back:\\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = ( (1 - t²) + i(2t) ) / (1 + t²) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) + i * (2t / (1 + t²))`\\n\\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts of this equation, we obtain the required formulas:\\nReal part: `cos(x) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²)`\\nImaginary part: `sin(x) = 2t / (1 + t²)`\\n\\nStep 4: Derive expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` in terms of `t`.\\nFirst, for `sec(x)`:\\n`sec(x) = 1 / cos(x) = 1 / [ (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) ] = (1 + t²) / (1 - t²)`\\n\\nNext, for `dx`, we start from `t = tan(x/2)`, which implies `x = 2*arctan(t)`. We differentiate `x` with respect to `t`:\\n`dx/dt = d/dt [2*arctan(t)]`\\nUsing the standard derivative `d/du[arctan(u)] = 1 / (1 + u²)`, we get:\\n`dx/dt = 2 * (1 / (1 + t²)) = 2 / (1 + t²)`\\nFrom this, we solve for the differential `dx`:\\n`dx = (2 / (1 + t²)) dt`\\n\\nStep 5: Substitute into the integral and solve.\\nWe substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` into the original integral `∫ sec(x) dx`:\\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ (1 + t²) / (1 - t²) ] * [ (2 / (1 + t²)) dt ]`\\n\\nThe `(1 + t²)` term in the numerator cancels with the `(1 + t²)` term in the denominator:\\n`∫ (2 / (1 - t²)) dt`\\n\\nThe sub-strategy specifies using partial fractions. We decompose the integrand `2 / (1 - t²)`. First, factor the denominator: `1 - t² = (1 - t)(1 + t)`.\\nThe partial fraction decomposition is of the form:\\n`2 / ((1 - t)(1 + t)) = A / (1 - t) + B / (1 + t)`\\n\\nTo find the coefficients `A` and `B`, we multiply both sides by the denominator `(1 - t)(1 + t)`:\\n`2 = A(1 + t) + B(1 - t)`\\n\\nWe solve for `A` by setting `t = 1`:\\n`2 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)  =>  2 = 2A  =>  A = 1`\\n\\nWe solve for `B` by setting `t = -1`:\\n`2 = A(1 - 1) + B(1 - (-1))  =>  2 = 2B  =>  B = 1`\\n\\nSo the integral becomes:\\n`∫ (1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)) dt`\\n`= ∫ 1/(1 + t) dt + ∫ 1/(1 - t) dt`\\n\\nWe integrate each term:\\n`∫ 1/(1 + t) dt = ln|1 + t|`\\n`∫ 1/(1 - t) dt = -ln|1 - t|` (using a u-substitution `u = 1 - t`, `du = -dt`)\\n\\nCombining the results, we have:\\n`ln|1 + t| - ln|1 - t| + C`\\n\\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\\n`ln| (1 + t) / (1 - t) | + C`\\n\\nStep 6: Back-substitute and simplify to final form.\\nFinally, we substitute `t = tan(x/2)` back into the result:\\n`ln| (1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) | + C`\\n\\nTo achieve the fully simplified, standard form of the answer, we simplify the argument of the logarithm.

Solutions 1, 2, and 3 all correctly use partial fraction decomposition, making them more compliant.\n\n2.  **Derivation of Formulas:** The heart of the Weierstrass substitution lies in the formulas that express trigonometric functions in terms of `t = tan(x/2)`. Solutions 1 and 3 derive these formulas using standard triangle geometry and identities. Solution 2, however, derives them from the more fundamental principles of complex analysis and Euler's formula (`e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)`). This approach is not only more elegant but also provides a deeper insight into the origin and nature of the substitution, connecting trigonometry to complex numbers in a beautiful way.\n\n3.  **Clarity and Execution:** Solution 1 contains a minor flaw where it begins a clumsy simplification in Step 6.2 before abandoning it for a better method; this detracts slightly from its elegance. Solution 3 is perfectly executed and extremely clear, serving as an excellent textbook example. Solution 2 is equally clear and flawlessly executed from start to finish.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Solution 2 is superior because it combines the most profound and elegant derivation of the core substitution formulas with a flawless and compliant execution of the subsequent integration and simplification steps. It demonstrates a deeper mathematical understanding than the other proposals while maintaining perfect rigor and clarity, making it the most exemplary solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Solution Text:**\nProblem: Calculate the integral of `sec(x)`.\n\nSub-Strategy: Complex Exponential Derivation via Euler's Formula. This plan utilizes complex analysis to establish the substitution formulas. Start with `t = tan(x/2)` and express `tan(x/2)` using the complex exponential definitions of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)` derived from Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`. Let `z = e^(ix/2)` and manipulate the resulting equation to solve for `z^2` (which is `e^(ix)`) as a rational function of `t`. Equate this expression for `e^(ix)` with its definition, `cos(x) + i*sin(x)`. Rationalize the complex rational function of `t` by multiplying by its conjugate, then equate the real and imaginary parts of the resulting equation to obtain expressions for `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`. From `cos(x)`, find `sec(x)`. Then, find `dx` by differentiating `x = 2*arctan(t)`. Substitute these formulas into the integral, solve the resulting rational integral in `t` using standard methods like partial fractions, and perform the final back-substitution to state the result in terms of `x`.\n\nExecution of the Sub-Strategy:\n\nStep 1: Express `tan(x/2)` using complex exponentials.\nThe sub-strategy begins by defining `t = tan(x/2)`. We will express this using the complex exponential forms of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)`.\n\nFrom Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`, we derive the definitions for cosine and sine:\n`cos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ)) / 2`\n`sin(θ) = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) / (2i)`\n\nApplying these for `θ = x/2`:\n`cos(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2`\n`sin(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i)`\n\nNow, we express `t = tan(x/2)`:\n`t = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2) = [ (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i) ] / [ (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2 ]`\n`t = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (i * (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)))`\n\nStep 2: Solve for `e^(ix)` in terms of `t`.\nLet `z = e^(ix/2)`, as per the sub-strategy. Then `z⁻¹ = e^(-ix/2)`. Substituting `z` into the expression for `t`:\n`t = (z - z⁻¹) / (i * (z + z⁻¹))`\n\nTo clear the complex fractions, we multiply the numerator and denominator inside the main fraction by `z`:\n`t = (z * (z - 1/z)) / (z * i * (z + 1/z))`\n`t = (z² - 1) / (i * (z² + 1))`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `z²`:\n`i * t * (z² + 1) = z² - 1`\n`i*t*z² + i*t = z² - 1`\n`1 + i*t = z² - i*t*z²`\n`1 + i*t = z² * (1 - i*t)`\n`z² = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nSince `z = e^(ix/2)`, we have `z² = (e^(ix/2))² = e^(ix)`. Therefore:\n`e^(ix) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nStep 3: Derive `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`.\nWe equate the definition `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)` with the expression derived in the previous step:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts, we rationalize the right-hand side by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is `(1 + i*t)`:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = [ (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t) ] * [ (1 + i*t) / (1 + i*t) ]`\n\nNumerator: `(1 + i*t)² = 1² + 2(1)(i*t) + (i*t)² = 1 + 2it + i²t² = 1 + 2it - t² = (1 - t²) + i(2t)`\nDenominator: `(1 - i*t)(1 + i*t) = 1² - (i*t)² = 1 - i²t² = 1 - (-1)t² = 1 + t²`\n\nSubstituting these back:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = ( (1 - t²) + i(2t) ) / (1 + t²) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) + i * (2t / (1 + t²))`\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts of this equation, we obtain the required formulas:\nReal part: `cos(x) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²)`\nImaginary part: `sin(x) = 2t / (1 + t²)`\n\nStep 4: Derive expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` in terms of `t`.\nFirst, for `sec(x)`:\n`sec(x) = 1 / cos(x) = 1 / [ (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) ] = (1 + t²) / (1 - t²)`\n\nNext, for `dx`, we start from `t = tan(x/2)`, which implies `x = 2*arctan(t)`. We differentiate `x` with respect to `t`:\n`dx/dt = d/dt [2*arctan(t)]`\nUsing the standard derivative `d/du[arctan(u)] = 1 / (1 + u²)`, we get:\n`dx/dt = 2 * (1 / (1 + t²)) = 2 / (1 + t²)`\nFrom this, we solve for the differential `dx`:\n`dx = (2 / (1 + t²)) dt`\n\nStep 5: Substitute into the integral and solve.\nWe substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` into the original integral `∫ sec(x) dx`:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ (1 + t²) / (1 - t²) ] * [ (2 / (1 + t²)) dt ]`\n\nThe `(1 + t²)` term in the numerator cancels with the `(1 + t²)` term in the denominator:\n`∫ (2 / (1 - t²)) dt`\n\nThe sub-strategy specifies using partial fractions. We decompose the integrand `2 / (1 - t²)`. First, factor the denominator: `1 - t² = (1 - t)(1 + t)`.\nThe partial fraction decomposition is of the form:\n`2 / ((1 - t)(1 + t)) = A / (1 - t) + B / (1 + t)`\n\nTo find the coefficients `A` and `B`, we multiply both sides by the denominator `(1 - t)(1 + t)`:\n`2 = A(1 + t) + B(1 - t)`\n\nWe solve for `A` by setting `t = 1`:\n`2 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)  =>  2 = 2A  =>  A = 1`\n\nWe solve for `B` by setting `t = -1`:\n`2 = A(1 - 1) + B(1 - (-1))  =>  2 = 2B  =>  B = 1`\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n`∫ (1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)) dt`\n`= ∫ 1/(1 + t) dt + ∫ 1/(1 - t) dt`\n\nWe integrate each term:\n`∫ 1/(1 + t) dt = ln|1 + t|`\n`∫ 1/(1 - t) dt = -ln|1 - t|` (using a u-substitution `u = 1 - t`, `du = -dt`)\n\nCombining the results, we have:\n`ln|1 + t| - ln|1 - t| + C`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\n`ln| (1 + t) / (1 - t) | + C`\n\nStep 6: Back-substitute and simplify to final form.\nFinally, we substitute `t = tan(x/2)` back into the result:\n`ln| (1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) | + C`\n\nTo achieve the fully simplified, standard form of the answer, we simplify the argument of the logarithm. We substitute `tan(x/2) = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2)`:\n` (1 + sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) / (1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) `\n`= [ (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ] / [ (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ]`\n`= (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))`\n\nTo simplify further, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`:\nNumerator: `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))² = cos²(x/2) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + sin²(x/2)`\nUsing the identities `cos²(θ) + sin²(θ) = 1` and `2sin(θ)cos(θ) = sin(2θ)`, the numerator becomes `1 + sin(2 * x/2) = 1 + sin(x)`.\n\nDenominator: `(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) = cos²(x/2) - sin²(x/2)`\nUsing the identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, the denominator becomes `cos(2 * x/2) = cos(x)`.\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n`(1 + sin(x)) / cos(x) = 1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`\n\nSubstituting this simplified expression back into the logarithmic result gives the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe definitive, fully simplified result of the integration is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

This strategy shifts the problem from the domain of continuous calculus to that of discrete infinite series. The approach is to operate on the power series representation of the function rather than the function itself. The process is: 1. Derive the Maclaurin series for sec(x). This requires finding a general formula for the nth derivative of sec(x) at x=0, which involves the Euler numbers (E_n), leading to a power series of the form Σ a_n * x^(2n). 2. Apply the principle of term-by-term integration to this power series, which is valid within its radius of convergence. This involves applying the power rule for integration to each term, generating a new series of the form C + Σ [a_n / (2n+1)] * x^(2n+1). 3. The crucial and most complex step is to perform 'series recognition': identify the function that this newly generated power series represents. 4. This requires independently deriving the Maclaurin series for the candidate solution function, ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), by computing its successive derivatives and establishing a pattern. 5. The final step is to prove the identity of the two series by showing that the coefficients of the integrated secant series match the coefficients of the series for ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), thereby confirming the integral's solution through the machinery of infinite series.",

Let f(x) = sec(x), so F^(k)(x) = f^(k-1)(x).\nThis implies F^(k)(0) = f^(k-1)(0) for k ≥ 1.\n\nConsider the coefficient of x^(2n+1) in the series for F(x) (where k = 2n+1):\n[F^(2n+1)(0)] / (2n+1)! = [f^(2n)(0)] / (2n+1)!\nFrom Part 1, we know f^(2n)(0) is the derivative that yields the coefficient a_{2n} for sec(x). Specifically, a_{2n} = f^(2n)(0) / (2n)! = E_{2n} / (2n)!. This gives f^(2n)(0) = E_{2n}.\nSubstituting this into the coefficient for F(x):\nCoefficient of x^(2n+1) = E_{2n} / (2n+1)!.\nThis matches the general coefficient from the integrated series S_int(x).\n\nConsider the coefficient of x^(2n) for n > 0 in the series for F(x) (where k = 2n):\n[F^(2n)(0)] / (2n)! = [f^(2n-1)(0)] / (2n)!\nFrom Part 1, we established that all odd-order derivatives of the even function sec(x) are zero at x=0. Thus, f^(2n-1)(0) = 0.\nThe coefficient is 0 / (2n)! = 0. This also matches S_int(x), which has no even power terms.\n\nThe constant term of S_F(x) is F(0) = 0. The constant term of S_int(x) is C.\nThe comparison demonstrates that S_F(x) = S_int(x) if C=0. More generally, the two series are identical up to a constant C.\n\nSince the Maclaurin series for ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) and the series for ∫ sec(x) dx are identical, we conclude that the functions they represent are identical (within the radius of convergence).\n\nThus, the identity is proven.\n\nThe definitive answer is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) + C"

The specified sub-strategy will be followed with absolute rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Derive the Maclaurin Series for sec(x)\n\nThe sub-strategy begins by deriving the Maclaurin series for sec(x) using the identity sec(x) = 1/cos(x) and formal power series long division.\n\nFirst, recall the Maclaurin series for cos(x):\ncos(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} ((-1)^n * x^(2n)) / (2n)! = 1 - x²/2! + x⁴/4! - x⁶/6! + ...\ncos(x) = 1 - (1/2)x² + (1/24)x⁴ - (1/720)x⁶ + O(x⁸)\n\nWe seek the series for sec(x) = 1/cos(x). Let this series be A₀ + A₁x + A₂x² + ... Since sec(x) is an even function (sec(-x) = sec(x)), all coefficients of odd powers of x must be zero (A₁, A₃, A₅, ... = 0). We can write the series as:\nsec(x) = A₀ + A₂x² + A₄x⁴ + A₆x⁶ + ...\n\nWe have the identity:\n1 = cos(x) * sec(x)\n1 = (1 - (1/2)x² + (1/24)x⁴ - (1/720)x⁶ + ...) * (A₀ + A₂x² + A₄x⁴ + A₆x⁶ + ...)\n\nWe expand the product on the right-hand side and equate coefficients of the powers of x with the coefficients on the left-hand side (which is 1, so only the constant term is non-zero).\n\n**Coefficient of x⁰ (constant term):**\n1 = 1 * A₀\n=> A₀ = 1\n\n**Coefficient of x²:**\n0 = 1 * A₂ - (1/2) * A₀\n0 = A₂ - 1/2\n=> A₂ = 1/2\n\n**Coefficient of x⁴:**\n0 = 1 * A₄ - (1/2) * A₂ + (1/24) * A₀\n0 = A₄ - (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/24)*1\n0 = A₄ - 1/4 + 1/24\nA₄ = 1/4 - 1/24 = 6/24 - 1/24\n=> A₄ = 5/24\n\n**Coefficient of x⁶:**\n0 = 1 * A₆ - (1/2) * A₄ + (1/24) * A₂ - (1/720) * A₀\n0 = A₆ - (1/2)*(5/24) + (1/24)*(1/2) - (1/720)*1\n0 = A₆ - 5/48 + 1/48 - 1/720\n0 = A₆ - 4/48 - 1/720\n0 = A₆ - 1/12 - 1/720\nA₆ = 1/12 + 1/720 = 60/720 + 1/720\n=> A₆ = 61/720\n\nThus, the Maclaurin series for sec(x) is:\nsec(x) = 1 + (1/2)x² + (5/24)x⁴ + (61/720)x⁶ + ...\n\n### Step 2: Integrate the sec(x) Power Series Term-by-Term\n\nThe sub-strategy now requires integrating the derived series for sec(x) term-by-term.\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ (1 + (1/2)x² + (5/24)x⁴ + (61/720)x⁶ + ...) dx\n\nWe integrate each term with respect to x:\n∫ 1 dx = x + C₀\n∫ (1/2)x² dx = (1/2) * (x³/3) = (1/6)x³\n∫ (5/24)x⁴ dx = (5/24) * (x⁵/5) = (1/24)x⁵\n∫ (61/720)x⁶ dx = (61/720) * (x⁷/7) = (61/5040)x⁷\n\nCombining these results, the integrated series is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = C + x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Result as the Gudermannian Function Series\n\nThe sub-strategy states that the resulting series is the Maclaurin series for the Gudermannian function, gd(x). The Gudermannian function is defined by the relation gd(x) = ∫₀ˣ sec(t) dt. This corresponds to the series derived in Step 2 with the constant of integration C=0.\nOne of the known forms of the Gudermannian function is gd(x) = arctanh(sin(x)). To verify this, we check its derivative:\nd/dx [arctanh(sin(x))]\nUsing the chain rule, with u = sin(x), d/du[arctanh(u)] = 1/(1-u²).\nd/dx [arctanh(sin(x))] = (1 / (1 - sin²(x))) * d/dx(sin(x))\n= (1 / cos²(x)) * cos(x)\n= 1 / cos(x) = sec(x)\nSince the derivative is sec(x) and arctanh(sin(0)) = arctanh(0) = 0, the function arctanh(sin(x)) is indeed the specific antiderivative of sec(x) that is zero at x=0.\n\n### Step 4: Independently Derive the Series for arctanh(sin(x))\n\nThe sub-strategy requires an independent derivation of the series for gd(x), which we have identified as arctanh(sin(x)). We will compute its Maclaurin series by finding its derivatives at x=0.\nLet f(x) = arctanh(sin(x)). The Maclaurin series is given by f(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} (f⁽ⁿ⁾(0) / n!) * xⁿ.\n\n*   **f(x) = arctanh(sin(x))**\n    f(0) = arctanh(sin(0)) = arctanh(0) = 0\n\n*   **f'(x) = sec(x)**\n    f'(0) = sec(0) = 1\n\n*   **f''(x) = d/dx(sec(x)) = sec(x)tan(x)**\n    f''(0) = sec(0)tan(0) = 1 * 0 = 0\n\n*   **f'''(x) = d/dx(sec(x)tan(x)) = sec(x) * sec²(x) + tan(x) * sec(x)tan(x) = sec³(x) + sec(x)tan²(x)**\n    f'''(0) = sec³(0) + sec(0)tan²(0) = 1³ + 1*(0)² = 1\n\n*   **f⁴(x) = d/dx(sec³(x) + sec(x)tan²(x))**\n    = 3sec²(x) * (sec(x)tan(x)) + [sec(x) * (2tan(x)sec²(x)) + tan²(x) * (sec(x)tan(x))]\n    = 3sec³(x)tan(x) + 2sec³(x)tan(x) + sec(x)tan³(x)\n    = 5sec³(x)tan(x) + sec(x)tan³(x)\n    f⁴(0) = 5sec³(0)tan(0) + sec(0)tan³(0) = 5*1*0 + 1*0 = 0\n\n*   **f⁵(x) = d/dx(5sec³(x)tan(x) + sec(x)tan³(x))**\n    = d/dx(5sec³(x)tan(x)) + d/dx(sec(x)tan³(x))\n    = [5(3sec²(x)sec(x)tan(x))tan(x) + 5sec³(x)sec²(x)] + [sec(x)tan(x)tan³(x) + sec(x)(3tan²(x)sec²(x))]\n    = 15sec³(x)tan²(x) + 5sec⁵(x) + sec(x)tan⁴(x) + 3sec³(x)tan²(x)\n    = 5sec⁵(x) + 18sec³(x)tan²(x) + sec(x)tan⁴(x)\n    f⁵(0) = 5sec⁵(0) + 18sec³(0)tan²(0) + sec(0)tan⁴(0) = 5*1 + 18*1*0 + 1*0 = 5\n\n*   **f⁶(x) = d/dx(f⁵(x))**. Since f⁵(x) is a sum of terms of the form C*secᵏ(x)tanᵐ(x) where m is even, its derivative will be a sum of terms where m is odd. Therefore, f⁶(0) will be 0.\n    f⁶(0) = 0\n\n*   **f⁷(x) = d/dx(f⁶(x))**. We first compute f⁶(x):\n    f⁶(x) = d/dx[5sec⁵(x) + 18sec³(x)tan²(x) + sec(x)tan⁴(x)]\n    = 5(5sec⁴(x)sec(x)tan(x)) + 18(3sec²(x)sec(x)tan(x))tan²(x) + 18sec³(x)(2tan(x)sec²(x)) + (sec(x)tan(x))tan⁴(x) + sec(x)(4tan³(x)sec²(x))\n    = 25sec⁵(x)tan(x) + 54sec³(x)tan³(x) + 36sec⁵(x)tan(x) + sec(x)tan⁵(x) + 4sec³(x)tan³(x)\n    = 61sec⁵(x)tan(x) + 58sec³(x)tan³(x) + sec(x)tan⁵(x)\n    Now, to find f⁷(0), we differentiate f⁶(x) and evaluate at x=0. We only need the terms that do not contain tan(x) after differentiation. This only occurs when differentiating tan(x) itself via the product rule.\n    d/dx[61sec⁵(x)tan(x)] = 61 * [(derivative of sec⁵(x)) * tan(x) + sec⁵(x) * (derivative of tan(x))]\n    The second part is 61 * sec⁵(x) * sec²(x) = 61sec⁷(x).\n    The derivatives of the other terms in f⁶(x) will all contain factors of tan²(x) or higher.\n    So, f⁷(x) = 61sec⁷(x) + [terms containing tan(x)].\n    f⁷(0) = 61sec⁷(0) + 0 = 61 * 1 = 61.\n\nNow, we construct the Maclaurin series for f(x) = arctanh(sin(x)):\nf(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + (f''(0)/2!)x² + (f'''(0)/3!)x³ + (f⁴(0)/4!)x⁴ + (f⁵(0)/5!)x⁵ + (f⁶(0)/6!)x⁶ + (f⁷(0)/7!)x⁷ + ...\nf(x) = 0 + (1)x + (0/2)x² + (1/6)x³ + (0/24)x⁴ + (5/120)x⁵ + (0/720)x⁶ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\nf(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\n\n### Step 5: Compare Series and Conclude\n\nWe now compare the two series derived.\nFrom Step 2, the integrated series for ∫ sec(x) dx is:\nC + x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\n\nFrom Step 4, the independently derived series for arctanh(sin(x)) is:\nx + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\n\nThe coefficients of the two series match exactly. This rigorously demonstrates that the integral of sec(x) is the function arctanh(sin(x)), plus a constant of integration.\nTherefore, ∫ sec(x) dx = arctanh(sin(x)) + C.\n\n### Step 6: Final Simplification\n\nTo present the answer in its most common and fully simplified elementary form, we convert the inverse hyperbolic tangent function into its logarithmic representation.\nThe identity for the inverse hyperbolic tangent is: arctanh(y) = (1/2)ln((1+y)/(1-y)).\nSubstituting y = sin(x):\narctanh(sin(x)) = (1/2)ln((1+sin(x))/(1-sin(x)))\n\nNow, we manipulate the argument of the logarithm:\n(1+sin(x))/(1-sin(x)) = [(1+sin(x))/(1-sin(x))] * [(1+sin(x))/(1+sin(x))]\n= (1+sin(x))² / (1-sin²(x))\nUsing the Pythagorean identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1, we have 1 - sin²(x) = cos²(x).\n= (1+sin(x))² / cos²(x)\n= [(1+sin(x))/cos(x)]²\n= [1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x)]²\n= (sec(x) + tan(x))²\n\nSubstituting this back into the logarithmic expression:\narctanh(sin(x)) = (1/2)ln((sec(x) + tan(x))²)\nUsing the logarithm property ln(aᵇ) = b*ln(a):\n= (1/2) * 2 * ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|\n= ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|\nThe absolute value is necessary because the argument of the logarithm must be positive, and sec(x)+tan(x) can be negative depending on the interval of x.\n\nThe sub-strategy has been followed to its complete and logical conclusion. The integral has been identified as the Gudermannian function, whose series was independently verified, and this function has been simplified to its standard logarithmic form.\n\nThe final, definitive, and fully simplified answer is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C"

This rigorously verifies the identity cosh(Y(x)) = sec(x) for the specific antiderivative Y(x) where Y(0)=0.\n\n**Part 4: Derivation of the Final Answer**\n\nFrom the verified identity cosh(Y(x)) = sec(x), we solve for Y(x).\nThe function cosh(y) is an even function, meaning cosh(y) = cosh(-y). Therefore, if Y(x) is a solution, then -Y(x) is also a solution. The equation cosh(Y(x)) = sec(x) implies |Y(x)| = arccosh(sec(x)), where arccosh is the principal (non-negative) value of the inverse hyperbolic cosine.\n\nLet's analyze the parity of the functions involved.\nThe series for Y(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + ... contains only odd powers, so Y(x) is an odd function: Y(-x) = -Y(x).\nThe function sec(x) is an even function, so arccosh(sec(x)) is also an even function.\nFor the equality to hold, the odd function Y(x) must be equal to an odd function. We construct an odd function from the even function arccosh(sec(x)) by multiplying by the signum function, sgn(x), which is odd.\nTherefore, the correct relationship is:\nY(x) = sgn(x) * arccosh(sec(x))\n\nThe logarithmic form of the principal value of inverse hyperbolic cosine is arccosh(z) = ln(z + √(z²-1)).\nSubstituting z = sec(x):\nY(x) = sgn(x) * ln(sec(x) + √(sec²(x)-1))\nUsing the identity sec²(x) - 1 = tan²(x), we get:\nY(x) = sgn(x) * ln(sec(x) + √(tan²(x)))\nY(x) = sgn(x) * ln(sec(x) + |tan(x)|)\n\nWe analyze this result on the principal interval (-π/2, π/2):\n1.  **For x ∈ [0, π/2):** sgn(x) = 1 and |tan(x)| = tan(x).\n    Y(x) = (1) * ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) = ln(sec(x) + tan(x)).\n2.  **For x ∈ (-π/2, 0):** sgn(x) = -1 and |tan(x)| = -tan(x).\n    Y(x) = (-1) * ln(sec(x) - tan(x)).\n    Using the identity sec(x) - tan(x) = (sec²(x) - tan²(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) = 1 / (sec(x) + tan(x)).\n    Y(x) = -ln( (sec(x) + tan(x))⁻¹ ) = -(-1)ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) = ln(sec(x) + tan(x)).\n\nIn both cases within the interval (-π/2, π/2), the result simplifies to ln(sec(x) + tan(x)). To generalize this for all intervals where the integral is defined, we use the absolute value, as sec(x) + tan(x) can be negative elsewhere.\n\nFinally, we reintroduce the constant of integration, C, to represent the general antiderivative.\n\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\nThis completes the derivation as per the specified sub-strategy."

Since sec(z) is analytic in a neighborhood of z=0 (specifically, for |z| < π/2), it can be represented by its Maclaurin series:\nsec(z) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} c_n * z^n\nwhere the coefficients c_n are given by c_n = f^(n)(0) / n!.\n\nCauchy's Integral Formula for derivatives states that for a function f(z) analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C enclosing a point a, the nth derivative at a is:\nf^(n)(a) = n! / (2πi) * ∫_C f(z) / (z-a)^(n+1) dz\n\nFor our Maclaurin series, a = 0. Thus, the coefficients c_n can be expressed as:\nc_n = (1/n!) * f^(n)(0) = (1/n!) * [ n! / (2πi) * ∫_C sec(z) / z^(n+1) dz ]\nc_n = 1 / (2πi) * ∫_C sec(z) / z^(n+1) dz\nHere, C is a small simple closed contour oriented counter-clockwise around the origin, contained within the disk |z| < π/2.\n\n**Step 1.2: Application of the Residue Theorem**\nThe Residue Theorem states that for a function g(z) with a finite number of isolated singularities z_k inside a contour C, ∫_C g(z) dz = 2πi * Σ_k Res(g, z_k).\n\nIn our case, the integrand is g(z) = sec(z) / z^(n+1). The function sec(z) = 1/cos(z) has simple poles at z = (k + 1/2)π for integer k. None of these poles are at the origin or inside a sufficiently small contour C around the origin. Therefore, the only singularity of g(z) inside C is at z=0.\n\nApplying the Residue Theorem to the expression for c_n:\n∫_C sec(z) / z^(n+1) dz = 2πi * Res(sec(z) / z^(n+1), z=0)\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for c_n:\nc_n = 1 / (2πi) * [ 2πi * Res(sec(z) / z^(n+1), z=0) ]\nc_n = Res(sec(z) / z^(n+1), z=0)\n\nBy definition, the residue of a function at a point z=0 is the coefficient of the z^(-1) term in its Laurent series expansion around z=0. The Laurent series of sec(z)/z^(n+1) is found by taking the Maclaurin series of sec(z) and dividing by z^(n+1):\nsec(z)/z^(n+1) = (1/z^(n+1)) * (c_0 + c_1*z + c_2*z^2 + ... + c_n*z^n + ...)\nsec(z)/z^(n+1) = c_0*z^(-n-1) + c_1*z^(-n) + ... + c_n*z^(-1) + c_(n+1)*z^0 + ...\nThe coefficient of the z^(-1) term is, by inspection, c_n. This confirms the consistency of the formalism but does not directly compute the coefficients' values.\n\n**Step 1.3: Identification of the Coefficients (Euler Numbers)**\nTo proceed, we identify the known structure of the sec(z) series. Since sec(z) = sec(-z), it is an even function. Consequently, all coefficients of odd powers in its Maclaurin series must be zero.\nc_{2k+1} = 0 for k ≥ 0.\n\nThe series is of the form sec(z) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} c_{2n} * z^{2n}. The non-zero coefficients are defined in terms of the Euler numbers (specifically, the secant numbers, which are a sequence of positive integers). We adopt the convention where the Euler numbers E_{2n} are all positive.\nThe Maclaurin series for sec(z) is:\nsec(z) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * z^{2n}\nwhere E_0 = 1, E_2 = 1, E_4 = 5, E_6 = 61, ...\nSo, c_{2n} = E_{2n} / (2n)!.\n\nThis establishes the series required by the sub-strategy, founded on the principles of complex analysis as requested.\n\n**Part 2: Term-by-Term Integration of the Series**\n\n**Step 2.1: Formulating the Integral**\nWe wish to calculate the indefinite integral of sec(x). We replace sec(x) with its power series representation:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ Σ_{n=0 to ∞} (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * x^{2n} ] dx\n\n**Step 2.2: Justifying and Performing the Integration**\nA power series can be integrated term-by-term within its interval of convergence. The radius of convergence for the series of sec(x) is R = π/2, so the interval is (-π/2, π/2). We can legally swap the integral and summation signs for x in this interval.\n∫ sec(x) dx = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ ∫ (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * x^{2n} dx ]\nThe term E_{2n} / (2n)! is a constant with respect to x.\n∫ sec(x) dx = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * ∫ x^{2n} dx ]\n\nWe use the power rule for integration, ∫ x^k dx = x^(k+1) / (k+1):\n∫ x^{2n} dx = x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)\n\nSubstituting this back into the sum:\n∫ sec(x) dx = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * (x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)) ] + C\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n**Step 2.3: Simplifying the Resulting Series**\nWe combine the factorial terms in the denominator: (2n)! * (2n+1) = (2n+1)!.\nThe resulting series, which represents the integral, is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1) + C\n\nLet S(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1). This is the specific antiderivative of sec(x) that is equal to 0 at x=0.\n\n**Part 3: Proving the Identity of the Integrated Series via Generating Function Matching**\n\nThe sub-strategy requires proving that S(x) is the generating function for a known function, specifically arctanh(sin(x)). The proof proceeds by showing that S(x) and arctanh(sin(x)) have the same derivative and the same value at x=0.\n\n**Step 3.1: Differentiating the Series S(x)**\nThis step is an \"algebraic manipulation of the obtained series\" as specified by the sub-strategy.\nS'(x) = d/dx [ S(x) ] = d/dx [ Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1) ]\n\nWe can differentiate the power series term-by-term within its interval of convergence:\nS'(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ d/dx ( [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1) ) ]\nS'(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ (E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ) * (2n+1) * x^(2n) ]\n\nNow, we simplify the coefficient:\nE_{2n} * (2n+1) / ((2n+1)!) = E_{2n} * (2n+1) / ((2n+1) * (2n)!) = E_{2n} / (2n)!\n\nSubstituting this simplified coefficient back into the series:\nS'(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / (2n)! ] * x^(2n)\n\nThis is precisely the Maclaurin series for sec(x) established in Part 1. Therefore, we have proven:\nS'(x) = sec(x)\n\n**Step 3.2: Differentiating the Target Function F(x) = arctanh(sin(x))**\nLet F(x) = arctanh(sin(x)). We find its derivative using the chain rule.\nLet u = sin(x). Then F(x) = arctanh(u).\nF'(x) = (dF/du) * (du/dx)\n\nThe derivative of arctanh(u) with respect to u is 1/(1-u^2).\nThe derivative of u = sin(x) with respect to x is cos(x).\n\nF'(x) = [ 1 / (1 - sin^2(x)) ] * [ cos(x) ]\n\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we have 1 - sin^2(x) = cos^2(x). This is valid for x in (-π/2, π/2) where cos(x) ≠ 0.\nF'(x) = [ 1 / cos^2(x) ] * cos(x)\nF'(x) = 1 / cos(x) = sec(x)\n\n**Step 3.3: Equating the Functions**\nWe have demonstrated that S'(x) = sec(x) and F'(x) = sec(x). This implies that the two functions differ by at most a constant:\nS(x) = F(x) + K for some constant K.\n\nTo determine K, we evaluate both functions at a convenient point, x=0, which is within the interval of convergence.\nS(0) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * 0^(2n+1) = 0 + 0 + 0 + ... = 0.\nF(0) = arctanh(sin(0)) = arctanh(0) = 0.\n\nSince S(0) = 0 and F(0) = 0, we have:\n0 = 0 + K  =>  K = 0.\n\nThus, we have rigorously proven that S(x) = F(x).\nΣ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1) = arctanh(sin(x))\n\n**Part 4: Final Answer Derivation and Simplification**\n\nThe calculation ∫ sec(x) dx = S(x) + C (where C is the general constant of integration) is now complete. We have proven that S(x) = arctanh(sin(x)).\nTherefore:\n∫ sec(x) dx = arctanh(sin(x)) + C\n\nAs a final step of simplification, we express this result in its more common logarithmic form. By definition, arctanh(y) = (1/2)ln((1+y)/(1-y)).\nLet y = sin(x).\narctanh(sin(x)) = (1/2)ln( (1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) )\n\nTo transform this to the standard form, we multiply the numerator and denominator inside the logarithm by (1 + sin(x)):\n= (1/2)ln( (1 + sin(x))^2 / ((1 - sin(x))(1 + sin(x))) )\n= (1/2)ln( (1 + sin(x))^2 / (1 - sin^2(x)) )\n= (1/2)ln( (1 + sin(x))^2 / cos^2(x) )\n= (1/2)ln( [ (1 + sin(x)) / cos(x) ]^2 )\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a^2) = 2ln|a|:\n= ln| (1 + sin(x)) / cos(x) |\n= ln| 1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) |\n= ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|\n\nThis derivation is valid for x in the interval (-π/2, π/2), and the absolute value handles the extension to other intervals where the integral is defined.\n\nThe definitive final answer, derived by meticulous application of the specified sub-strategy, is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C"

This strategy shifts the problem from the domain of continuous calculus to that of discrete infinite series. The approach is to operate on the power series representation of the function rather than the function itself. The process is: 1. Derive the Maclaurin series for sec(x). This requires finding a general formula for the nth derivative of sec(x) at x=0, which involves the Euler numbers (E_n), leading to a power series of the form Σ a_n * x^(2n). 2. Apply the principle of term-by-term integration to this power series, which is valid within its radius of convergence. This involves applying the power rule for integration to each term, generating a new series of the form C + Σ [a_n / (2n+1)] * x^(2n+1). 3. The crucial and most complex step is to perform 'series recognition': identify the function that this newly generated power series represents. 4. This requires independently deriving the Maclaurin series for the candidate solution function, ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), by computing its successive derivatives and establishing a pattern. 5. The final step is to prove the identity of the two series by showing that the coefficients of the integrated secant series match the coefficients of the series for ln(sec(x) + tan(x)), thereby confirming the integral's solution through the machinery of infinite series.\"\n\nFor your situational awareness ONLY (YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO USE, REFER TO, BE INSPIRED BY, OR CONTAMINATED BY THEM IN YOUR SUB-STRATEGIES - THEY ARE STRICTLY OFF-LIMITS AND EXIST IN A SEPARATE UNIVERSE): Other main strategies being explored in parallel by different entities are: Strategy 1: Algebraic Augmentation for Logarithmic Form. This strategy operates on the principle of transforming the integrand by introducing a specifically constructed multiplicative identity. The core insight is to hypothesize that the integrand, sec(x), is a component of a function whose form is f'(x)/f(x), which integrates to ln|f(x)|. The procedure involves: 1. Postulating the existence of a function g(x) such that multiplying sec(x) by g(x)/g(x) yields the desired logarithmic precursor form. 2. Analyzing the derivatives of functions related to sec(x), specifically sec(x) and tan(x), to identify a suitable candidate for f(x). The derivative of a linear combination, f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x), is examined. 3. Verifying that the derivative f'(x) is precisely sec(x) * f(x). This confirms the hypothesis that sec(x) can be rewritten as f'(x)/f(x). 4. Concluding that the integral can be solved by direct application of the integration rule for logarithmic derivatives, thereby bypassing more complex substitutions or transformations.; Strategy 2: Conformal Geometric Derivation. This strategy reframes the integration problem as a fundamental problem in differential geometry and cartography: the construction of a conformal (angle-preserving) map from a sphere to a cylinder. The integral emerges as a necessary consequence of the geometric constraints. The steps are: 1. Model the Earth as a sphere with the standard Riemannian metric expressed in latitude (φ) and longitude (λ) coordinates: ds² = R²(dφ² + cos²(φ)dλ²). 2. Define a projection onto a cylinder where the cylindrical coordinates are x = Rλ and y = y(φ). The metric on the cylinder is ds² = dx² + dy². 3. Impose the condition of conformality, which requires that the metric pulled back from the cylinder to the sphere is a scalar multiple of the original sphere metric. This means f*(g_cyl) = Ω²(φ) * g_sphere. 4. By expressing the pullback metric in terms of y'(φ) and comparing the coefficients of the dλ² and dφ² terms in the two metrics, derive two equations. 5. Solve the first equation for the scaling factor Ω(φ), which will be found to be sec(φ). 6. Substitute this scaling factor into the second equation, which yields a first-order ordinary differential equation for y(φ) of the form y'(φ) = R sec(φ). 7. The problem of finding the integral of secant is thus transformed into solving for the y-coordinate of the Mercator projection, with the integral being the solution to this geometrically derived differential equation.; Strategy 3: Universal Rationalization via Stereographic Projection. This strategy transforms the transcendental integrand into a purely algebraic one by re-parameterizing the trigonometric functions. It leverages the Weierstrass substitution (t = tan(x/2)), which is conceptually equivalent to a stereographic projection of the unit circle onto the real line. The pathway is: 1. Introduce the substitution t = tan(x/2). 2. Utilize fundamental trigonometric half-angle identities to derive expressions for sin(x), cos(x), and consequently sec(x), as rational functions of the variable t. 3. Derive the differential relationship between dx and dt by differentiating the substitution formula, resulting in an expression for dx as a rational function of t. 4. Substitute the rational expressions for both sec(x) and dx into the integral, thereby converting the entire trigonometric integral into an integral of a rational function in t. 5. Solve this new, purely algebraic integral using standard, systematic techniques for rational functions, namely the method of partial fraction decomposition. 6. Once the antiderivative is found in terms of t, perform the back-substitution t = tan(x/2) to express the final solution in terms of the original variable x.\n\nYour mission as 'Strategem Decomposer Maxima': Devise 4 **ENTIRELY NOVEL, UNIQUE, FULLY INDEPENDENT, and SELF-CONTAINED mini-plans (sub-strategies)**.

This strategy operates on the principle of transforming the integrand by introducing a specifically constructed multiplicative identity. The core insight is to hypothesize that the integrand, sec(x), is a component of a function whose form is f'(x)/f(x), which integrates to ln|f(x)|. The procedure involves: 1. Postulating the existence of a function g(x) such that multiplying sec(x) by g(x)/g(x) yields the desired logarithmic precursor form. 2. Analyzing the derivatives of functions related to sec(x), specifically sec(x) and tan(x), to identify a suitable candidate for f(x). The derivative of a linear combination, f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x), is examined. 3. Verifying that the derivative f'(x) is precisely sec(x) * f(x).

To prove the identity formally, we compare the general coefficients.\n\nLet S_int(x) = C + Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [E_{2n} / (2n+1)!] * x^(2n+1).\nLet S_F(x) = Σ_{k=0 to ∞} [F^(k)(0) / k!] * x^k.\n\nWe established in Part 4 that F'(x) = sec(x). Therefore, for k ≥ 1, F^(k)(x) = d^(k-1)/dx^(k-1) [sec(x)]. Let f(x) = sec(x), so F^(k)(x) = f^(k-1)(x).\nThis implies F^(k)(0) = f^(k-1)(0) for k ≥ 1.\n\nConsider the coefficient of x^(2n+1) in the series for F(x) (where k = 2n+1):\n[F^(2n+1)(0)] / (2n+1)! = [f^(2n)(0)] / (2n+1)!\nFrom Part 1, we know f^(2n)(0) is the derivative that yields the coefficient a_{2n} for sec(x). Specifically, a_{2n} = f^(2n)(0) / (2n)! = E_{2n} / (2n)!. This gives f^(2n)(0) = E_{2n}.\nSubstituting this into the coefficient for F(x):\nCoefficient of x^(2n+1) = E_{2n} / (2n+1)!.\nThis matches the general coefficient from the integrated series S_int(x).\n\nConsider the coefficient of x^(2n) for n > 0 in the series for F(x) (where k = 2n):\n[F^(2n)(0)] / (2n)! = [f^(2n-1)(0)] / (2n)!\nFrom Part 1, we established that all odd-order derivatives of the even function sec(x) are zero at x=0. Thus, f^(2n-1)(0) = 0.\nThe coefficient is 0 / (2n)! = 0. This also matches S_int(x), which has no even power terms.\n\nThe constant term of S_F(x) is F(0) = 0. The constant term of S_int(x) is C.\nThe comparison demonstrates that S_F(x) = S_int(x) if C=0. More generally, the two series are identical up to a constant C.\n\nSince the Maclaurin series for ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) and the series for ∫ sec(x) dx are identical, we conclude that the functions they represent are identical (within the radius of convergence).\n\nThus, the identity is proven.\n\nThe definitive answer is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) + C\n\n--- SOLUTION 2 (ID: main3-sub1) ---\nThe problem is to compute the integral of sec(x), denoted as ∫ sec(x) dx. The specified sub-strategy will be followed with absolute rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Derive the Maclaurin Series for sec(x)\n\nThe sub-strategy begins by deriving the Maclaurin series for sec(x) using the identity sec(x) = 1/cos(x) and formal power series long division.\n\nFirst, recall the Maclaurin series for cos(x):\ncos(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} ((-1)^n * x^(2n)) / (2n)! = 1 - x²/2! + x⁴/4! - x⁶/6! + ...\ncos(x) = 1 - (1/2)x² + (1/24)x⁴ - (1/720)x⁶ + O(x⁸)\n\nWe seek the series for sec(x) = 1/cos(x). Let this series be A₀ + A₁x + A₂x² + ... Since sec(x) is an even function (sec(-x) = sec(x)), all coefficients of odd powers of x must be zero (A₁, A₃, A₅, ... = 0). We can write the series as:\nsec(x) = A₀ + A₂x² + A₄x⁴ + A₆x⁶ + ...\n\nWe have the identity:\n1 = cos(x) * sec(x)\n1 = (1 - (1/2)x² + (1/24)x⁴ - (1/720)x⁶ + ...) * (A₀ + A₂x² + A₄x⁴ + A₆x⁶ + ...)\n\nWe expand the product on the right-hand side and equate coefficients of the powers of x with the coefficients on the left-hand side (which is 1, so only the constant term is non-zero).\n\n**Coefficient of x⁰ (constant term):**\n1 = 1 * A₀\n=> A₀ = 1\n\n**Coefficient of x²:**\n0 = 1 * A₂ - (1/2) * A₀\n0 = A₂ - 1/2\n=> A₂ = 1/2\n\n**Coefficient of x⁴:**\n0 = 1 * A₄ - (1/2) * A₂ + (1/24) * A₀\n0 = A₄ - (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/24)*1\n0 = A₄ - 1/4 + 1/24\nA₄ = 1/4 - 1/24 = 6/24 - 1/24\n=> A₄ = 5/24\n\n**Coefficient of x⁶:**\n0 = 1 * A₆ - (1/2) * A₄ + (1/24) * A₂ - (1/720) * A₀\n0 = A₆ - (1/2)*(5/24) + (1/24)*(1/2) - (1/720)*1\n0 = A₆ - 5/48 + 1/48 - 1/720\n0 = A₆ - 4/48 - 1/720\n0 = A₆ - 1/12 - 1/720\nA₆ = 1/12 + 1/720 = 60/720 + 1/720\n=> A₆ = 61/720\n\nThus, the Maclaurin series for sec(x) is:\nsec(x) = 1 + (1/2)x² + (5/24)x⁴ + (61/720)x⁶ + ...\n\n### Step 2: Integrate the sec(x) Power Series Term-by-Term\n\nThe sub-strategy now requires integrating the derived series for sec(x) term-by-term.\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ (1 + (1/2)x² + (5/24)x⁴ + (61/720)x⁶ + ...) dx\n\nWe integrate each term with respect to x:\n∫ 1 dx = x + C₀\n∫ (1/2)x² dx = (1/2) * (x³/3) = (1/6)x³\n∫ (5/24)x⁴ dx = (5/24) * (x⁵/5) = (1/24)x⁵\n∫ (61/720)x⁶ dx = (61/720) * (x⁷/7) = (61/5040)x⁷\n\nCombining these results, the integrated series is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = C + x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Result as the Gudermannian Function Series\n\nThe sub-strategy states that the resulting series is the Maclaurin series for the Gudermannian function, gd(x). The Gudermannian function is defined by the relation gd(x) = ∫₀ˣ sec(t) dt. This corresponds to the series derived in Step 2 with the constant of integration C=0.\nOne of the known forms of the Gudermannian function is gd(x) = arctanh(sin(x)). To verify this, we check its derivative:\nd/dx [arctanh(sin(x))]\nUsing the chain rule, with u = sin(x), d/du[arctanh(u)] = 1/(1-u²).\nd/dx [arctanh(sin(x))] = (1 / (1 - sin²(x))) * d/dx(sin(x))\n= (1 / cos²(x)) * cos(x)\n= 1 / cos(x) = sec(x)\nSince the derivative is sec(x) and arctanh(sin(0)) = arctanh(0) = 0, the function arctanh(sin(x)) is indeed the specific antiderivative of sec(x) that is zero at x=0.\n\n### Step 4: Independently Derive the Series for arctanh(sin(x))\n\nThe sub-strategy requires an independent derivation of the series for gd(x), which we have identified as arctanh(sin(x)). We will compute its Maclaurin series by finding its derivatives at x=0.\nLet f(x) = arctanh(sin(x)). The Maclaurin series is given by f(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} (f⁽ⁿ⁾(0) / n!) * xⁿ.\n\n*   **f(x) = arctanh(sin(x))**\n    f(0) = arctanh(sin(0)) = arctanh(0) = 0\n\n*   **f'(x) = sec(x)**\n    f'(0) = sec(0) = 1\n\n*   **f''(x) = d/dx(sec(x)) = sec(x)tan(x)**\n    f''(0) = sec(0)tan(0) = 1 * 0 = 0\n\n*   **f'''(x) = d/dx(sec(x)tan(x)) = sec(x) * sec²(x) + tan(x) * sec(x)tan(x) = sec³(x) + sec(x)tan²(x)**\n    f'''(0) = sec³(0) + sec(0)tan²(0) = 1³ + 1*(0)² = 1\n\n*   **f⁴(x) = d/dx(sec³(x) + sec(x)tan²(x))**\n    = 3sec²(x) * (sec(x)tan(x)) + [sec(x) * (2tan(x)sec²(x)) + tan²(x) * (sec(x)tan(x))]\n    = 3sec³(x)tan(x) + 2sec³(x)tan(x) + sec(x)tan³(x)\n    = 5sec³(x)tan(x) + sec(x)tan³(x)\n    f⁴(0) = 5sec³(0)tan(0) + sec(0)tan³(0) = 5*1*0 + 1*0 = 0\n\n*   **f⁵(x) = d/dx(5sec³(x)tan(x) + sec(x)tan³(x))**\n    = d/dx(5sec³(x)tan(x)) + d/dx(sec(x)tan³(x))\n    = [5(3sec²(x)sec(x)tan(x))tan(x) + 5sec³(x)sec²(x)] + [sec(x)tan(x)tan³(x) + sec(x)(3tan²(x)sec²(x))]\n    = 15sec³(x)tan²(x) + 5sec⁵(x) + sec(x)tan⁴(x) + 3sec³(x)tan²(x)\n    = 5sec⁵(x) + 18sec³(x)tan²(x) + sec(x)tan⁴(x)\n    f⁵(0) = 5sec⁵(0) + 18sec³(0)tan²(0) + sec(0)tan⁴(0) = 5*1 + 18*1*0 + 1*0 = 5\n\n*   **f⁶(x) = d/dx(f⁵(x))**. Since f⁵(x) is a sum of terms of the form C*secᵏ(x)tanᵐ(x) where m is even, its derivative will be a sum of terms where m is odd. Therefore, f⁶(0) will be 0.\n    f⁶(0) = 0\n\n*   **f⁷(x) = d/dx(f⁶(x))**. We first compute f⁶(x):\n    f⁶(x) = d/dx[5sec⁵(x) + 18sec³(x)tan²(x) + sec(x)tan⁴(x)]\n    = 5(5sec⁴(x)sec(x)tan(x)) + 18(3sec²(x)sec(x)tan(x))tan²(x) + 18sec³(x)(2tan(x)sec²(x)) + (sec(x)tan(x))tan⁴(x) + sec(x)(4tan³(x)sec²(x))\n    = 25sec⁵(x)tan(x) + 54sec³(x)tan³(x) + 36sec⁵(x)tan(x) + sec(x)tan⁵(x) + 4sec³(x)tan³(x)\n    = 61sec⁵(x)tan(x) + 58sec³(x)tan³(x) + sec(x)tan⁵(x)\n    Now, to find f⁷(0), we differentiate f⁶(x) and evaluate at x=0. We only need the terms that do not contain tan(x) after differentiation. This only occurs when differentiating tan(x) itself via the product rule.\n    d/dx[61sec⁵(x)tan(x)] = 61 * [(derivative of sec⁵(x)) * tan(x) + sec⁵(x) * (derivative of tan(x))]\n    The second part is 61 * sec⁵(x) * sec²(x) = 61sec⁷(x).\n    The derivatives of the other terms in f⁶(x) will all contain factors of tan²(x) or higher.\n    So, f⁷(x) = 61sec⁷(x) + [terms containing tan(x)].\n    f⁷(0) = 61sec⁷(0) + 0 = 61 * 1 = 61.\n\nNow, we construct the Maclaurin series for f(x) = arctanh(sin(x)):\nf(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + (f''(0)/2!)x² + (f'''(0)/3!)x³ + (f⁴(0)/4!)x⁴ + (f⁵(0)/5!)x⁵ + (f⁶(0)/6!)x⁶ + (f⁷(0)/7!)x⁷ + ...\nf(x) = 0 + (1)x + (0/2)x² + (1/6)x³ + (0/24)x⁴ + (5/120)x⁵ + (0/720)x⁶ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\nf(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\n\n### Step 5: Compare Series and Conclude\n\nWe now compare the two series derived.\nFrom Step 2, the integrated series for ∫ sec(x) dx is:\nC + x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\n\nFrom Step 4, the independently derived series for arctanh(sin(x)) is:\nx + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\n\nThe coefficients of the two series match exactly. This rigorously demonstrates that the integral of sec(x) is the function arctanh(sin(x)), plus a constant of integration.\nTherefore, ∫ sec(x) dx = arctanh(sin(x)) + C.\n\n### Step 6: Final Simplification\n\nTo present the answer in its most common and fully simplified elementary form, we convert the inverse hyperbolic tangent function into its logarithmic representation.\nThe identity for the inverse hyperbolic tangent is: arctanh(y) = (1/2)ln((1+y)/(1-y)).\nSubstituting y = sin(x):\narctanh(sin(x)) = (1/2)ln((1+sin(x))/(1-sin(x)))\n\nNow, we manipulate the argument of the logarithm:\n(1+sin(x))/(1-sin(x)) = [(1+sin(x))/(1-sin(x))] * [(1+sin(x))/(1+sin(x))]\n= (1+sin(x))² / (1-sin²(x))\nUsing the Pythagorean identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1, we have 1 - sin²(x) = cos²(x).\n= (1+sin(x))² / cos²(x)\n= [(1+sin(x))/cos(x)]²\n= [1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x)]²\n= (sec(x) + tan(x))²\n\nSubstituting this back into the logarithmic expression:\narctanh(sin(x)) = (1/2)ln((sec(x) + tan(x))²)\nUsing the logarithm property ln(aᵇ) = b*ln(a):\n= (1/2) * 2 * ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|\n= ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|\nThe absolute value is necessary because the argument of the logarithm must be positive, and sec(x)+tan(x) can be negative depending on the interval of x.\n\nThe sub-strategy has been followed to its complete and logical conclusion. The integral has been identified as the Gudermannian function, whose series was independently verified, and this function has been simplified to its standard logarithmic form.\n\nThe final, definitive, and fully simplified answer is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\n--- SOLUTION 3 (ID: main3-sub2) ---\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Maclaurin Series for sec(x)**\n\nThe sub-strategy begins by finding the Maclaurin series for sec(x). We assume the series has the form S(x) = sec(x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ a_n * x^n. We use the fundamental identity cos(x) * sec(x) = 1.\n\nThe Maclaurin series for cos(x) is:\ncos(x) = 1 - x²/2! + x⁴/4! - x⁶/6! + ... = 1 - (1/2)x² + (1/24)x⁴ - (1/720)x⁶ + ...\n\nWe set the product of the series for cos(x) and sec(x) equal to the series for 1:\n(1 - (1/2)x² + (1/24)x⁴ - ...) * (a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + a₃x³ + a₄x⁴ + ...) = 1 + 0x + 0x² + 0x³ + 0x⁴ + ...\n\nWe find the coefficients a_n by equating the coefficients of each power of x on both sides of the equation.\n\n*   **Coefficient of x⁰ (constant term):**\n    1 * a₀ = 1\n    a₀ = 1\n\n*   **Coefficient of x¹:**\n    1 * a₁ = 0\n    a₁ = 0\n    (Since sec(x) is an even function, all coefficients of odd powers of x must be zero. Thus, a₁ = a₃ = a₅ = ... = 0).\n\n*   **Coefficient of x²:**\n    (1 * a₂) + (a₀ * -1/2) = 0\n    a₂ + (1 * -1/2) = 0\n    a₂ - 1/2 = 0\n    a₂ = 1/2\n\n*   **Coefficient of x³:**\n    (1 * a₃) + (a₁ * -1/2) = 0\n    a₃ + (0 * -1/2) = 0\n    a₃ = 0\n\n*   **Coefficient of x⁴:**\n    (1 * a₄) + (a₂ * -1/2) + (a₀ * 1/24) = 0\n    a₄ + (1/2 * -1/2) + (1 * 1/24) = 0\n    a₄ - 1/4 + 1/24 = 0\n    a₄ = 1/4 - 1/24 = 6/24 - 1/24 = 5/24\n    a₄ = 5/24\n\n*   **Coefficient of x⁶:**\n    (1 * a₆) + (a₄ * -1/2) + (a₂ * 1/24) + (a₀ * -1/720) = 0\n    a₆ + (5/24 * -1/2) + (1/2 * 1/24) + (1 * -1/720) = 0\n    a₆ - 5/48 + 1/48 - 1/720 = 0\n    a₆ - 4/48 - 1/720 = 0\n    a₆ - 1/12 - 1/720 = 0\n    a₆ = 1/12 + 1/720 = 60/720 + 1/720 = 61/720\n    a₆ = 61/720\n\nThus, the Maclaurin series for sec(x) is:\nsec(x) = 1 + (1/2)x² + (5/24)x⁴ + (61/720)x⁶ + ...\n\n**Part 2: Term-wise Integration of the Series**\n\nNext, we integrate the series for sec(x) term-by-term to find the series for its antiderivative, which we call Y(x).\nY(x) = ∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ (1 + (1/2)x² + (5/24)x⁴ + (61/720)x⁶ + ...) dx\nY(x) = C + x + (1/2) * (x³/3) + (5/24) * (x⁵/5) + (61/720) * (x⁷/7) + ...\nY(x) = C + x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\n\nFor the purpose of verifying the identity in the next step, we consider the specific antiderivative for which the constant of integration C is 0 (i.e., Y(0)=0).\nY(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + (61/5040)x⁷ + ...\n\n**Part 3: Verification of the Identity cosh(Y(x)) = sec(x)**\n\nThe core of the sub-strategy is to verify the identity cosh(Y(x)) = sec(x) at the series level.\nThe Maclaurin series for cosh(y) is:\ncosh(y) = 1 + y²/2! + y⁴/4! + y⁶/6! + ... = 1 + (1/2)y² + (1/24)y⁴ + (1/720)y⁶ + ...\n\nWe substitute the series for Y(x) into this series. First, we compute the necessary powers of Y(x):\nY(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + O(x⁷)\n\n*   **Y(x)²:**\n    Y(x)² = (x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + ...)²\n    = x² + 2(x)(1/6)x³ + ( (1/6)x³ )² + 2(x)(1/24)x⁵ + ...\n    = x² + (1/3)x⁴ + (1/36)x⁶ + (1/12)x⁶ + ...\n    = x² + (1/3)x⁴ + (1/36 + 3/36)x⁶ + ...\n    = x² + (1/3)x⁴ + (1/9)x⁶ + O(x⁸)\n\n*   **Y(x)⁴:**\n    Y(x)⁴ = (Y(x)²)² = (x² + (1/3)x⁴ + (1/9)x⁶ + ...)²\n    = (x²)² + 2(x²)(1/3)x⁴ + ...\n    = x⁴ + (2/3)x⁶ + O(x⁸)\n\n*   **Y(x)⁶:**\n    Y(x)⁶ = (x²)³ + O(x⁸) = x⁶ + O(x⁸)\n\nNow, we substitute these series into the expansion for cosh(Y(x)):\ncosh(Y(x)) = 1 + (1/2)Y(x)² + (1/24)Y(x)⁴ + (1/720)Y(x)⁶ + ...\ncosh(Y(x)) = 1 + (1/2)[x² + (1/3)x⁴ + (1/9)x⁶ + ...] + (1/24)[x⁴ + (2/3)x⁶ + ...] + (1/720)[x⁶ + ...]\ncosh(Y(x)) = 1 + (1/2)x² + (1/6)x⁴ + (1/18)x⁶ + (1/24)x⁴ + (2/72)x⁶ + (1/720)x⁶ + ...\n\nWe collect the terms by powers of x:\n*   **Constant term:** 1\n*   **x² term:** 1/2\n*   **x⁴ term:** 1/6 + 1/24 = 4/24 + 1/24 = 5/24\n*   **x⁶ term:** 1/18 + 2/72 + 1/720 = 1/18 + 1/36 + 1/720 = 40/720 + 20/720 + 1/720 = 61/720\n\nThe resulting series is:\ncosh(Y(x)) = 1 + (1/2)x² + (5/24)x⁴ + (61/720)x⁶ + ...\n\nThis series is identical, term by term, to the series for sec(x) derived in Part 1. This rigorously verifies the identity cosh(Y(x)) = sec(x) for the specific antiderivative Y(x) where Y(0)=0.\n\n**Part 4: Derivation of the Final Answer**\n\nFrom the verified identity cosh(Y(x)) = sec(x), we solve for Y(x).\nThe function cosh(y) is an even function, meaning cosh(y) = cosh(-y). Therefore, if Y(x) is a solution, then -Y(x) is also a solution. The equation cosh(Y(x)) = sec(x) implies |Y(x)| = arccosh(sec(x)), where arccosh is the principal (non-negative) value of the inverse hyperbolic cosine.\n\nLet's analyze the parity of the functions involved.\nThe series for Y(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + ... contains only odd powers, so Y(x) is an odd function: Y(-x) = -Y(x).\nThe function sec(x) is an even function, so arccosh(sec(x)) is also an even function.\nFor the equality to hold, the odd function Y(x) must be equal to an odd function. We construct an odd function from the even function arccosh(sec(x)) by multiplying by the signum function, sgn(x), which is odd.\nTherefore, the correct relationship is:\nY(x) = sgn(x) * arccosh(sec(x))\n\nThe logarithmic form of the principal value of inverse hyperbolic cosine is arccosh(z) = ln(z + √(z²-1)).\nSubstituting z = sec(x):\nY(x) = sgn(x) * ln(sec(x) + √(sec²(x)-1))\nUsing the identity sec²(x) - 1 = tan²(x), we get:\nY(x) = sgn(x) * ln(sec(x) + √(tan²(x)))\nY(x) = sgn(x) * ln(sec(x) + |tan(x)|)\n\nWe analyze this result on the principal interval (-π/2, π/2):\n1.  **For x ∈ [0, π/2):** sgn(x) = 1 and |tan(x)| = tan(x).\n    Y(x) = (1) * ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) = ln(sec(x) + tan(x)).\n2.  **For x ∈ (-π/2, 0):** sgn(x) = -1 and |tan(x)| = -tan(x).\n    Y(x) = (-1) * ln(sec(x) - tan(x)).\n    Using the identity sec(x) - tan(x) = (sec²(x) - tan²(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) = 1 / (sec(x) + tan(x)).\n    Y(x) = -ln( (sec(x) + tan(x))⁻¹ ) = -(-1)ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) = ln(sec(x) + tan(x)).\n\nIn both cases within the interval (-π/2, π/2), the result simplifies to ln(sec(x) + tan(x)). To generalize this for all intervals where the integral is defined, we use the absolute value, as sec(x) + tan(x) can be negative elsewhere.\n\nFinally, we reintroduce the constant of integration, C, to represent the general antiderivative.\n\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\nThis completes the derivation as per the specified sub-strategy.\n\n--- SOLUTION 4 (ID: main3-sub3) ---\nHere begins the rigorous derivation of the integral of sec(x) following the specified sub-strategy.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Maclaurin Series for sec(z) via Complex Analysis Formalism**\n\nThe sub-strategy requires establishing the Maclaurin series for sec(z) using the framework of complex analysis.\n\n**Step 1.1: Formal Representation using Cauchy's Integral Formula**\nLet f(z) = sec(z). Since sec(z) is analytic in a neighborhood of z=0 (specifically, for |z| < π/2), it can be represented by its Maclaurin series:\nsec(z) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} c_n * z^n\nwhere the coefficients c_n are given by c_n = f^(n)(0) / n!.\n\nCauchy's Integral Formula for derivatives states that for a function f(z) analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C enclosing a point a, the nth derivative at a is:\nf^(n)(a) = n! / (2πi) * ∫_C f(z) / (z-a)^(n+1) dz\n\nFor our Maclaurin series, a = 0. Thus, the coefficients c_n can be expressed as:\nc_n = (1/n!) * f^(n)(0) = (1/n!) * [ n! / (2πi) * ∫_C sec(z) / z^(n+1) dz ]\nc_n = 1 / (2πi) * ∫_C sec(z) / z^(n+1) dz\nHere, C is a small simple closed contour oriented counter-clockwise around the origin, contained within the disk |z| < π/2.\n\n**Step 1.2: Application of the Residue Theorem**\nThe Residue Theorem states that for a function g(z) with a finite number of isolated singularities z_k inside a contour C, ∫_C g(z) dz = 2πi * Σ_k Res(g, z_k).\n\nIn our case, the integrand is g(z) = sec(z) / z^(n+1). The function sec(z) = 1/cos(z) has simple poles at z = (k + 1/2)π for integer k. None of these poles are at the origin or inside a sufficiently small contour C around the origin. Therefore, the only singularity of g(z) inside C is at z=0.\n\nApplying the Residue Theorem to the expression for c_n:\n∫_C sec(z) / z^(n+1) dz = 2πi * Res(sec(z) / z^(n+1), z=0)\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for c_n:\nc_n = 1 / (2πi) * [ 2πi * Res(sec(z) / z^(n+1), z=0) ]\nc_n = Res(sec(z) / z^(n+1), z=0)\n\nBy definition, the residue of a function at a point z=0 is the coefficient of the z^(-1) term in its Laurent series expansion around z=0. The Laurent series of sec(z)/z^(n+1) is found by taking the Maclaurin series of sec(z) and dividing by z^(n+1):\nsec(z)/z^(n+1) = (1/z^(n+1)) * (c_0 + c_1*z + c_2*z^2 + ... + c_n*z^n + ...)\nsec(z)/z^(n+1) = c_0*z^(-n-1) + c_1*z^(-n) + ... + c_n*z^(-1) + c_(n+1)*z^0 + ...\nThe coefficient of the z^(-1) term is, by inspection, c_n. This confirms the consistency of the formalism but does not directly compute the coefficients' values.\n\n**Step 1.3: Identification of the Coefficients (Euler Numbers)**\nTo proceed, we identify the known structure of the sec(z) series. Since sec(z) = sec(-z), it is an even function. Consequently, all coefficients of odd powers in its Maclaurin series must be zero.\nc_{2k+1} = 0 for k ≥ 0.\n\nThe series is of the form sec(z) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} c_{2n} * z^{2n}. The non-zero coefficients are defined in terms of the Euler numbers (specifically, the secant numbers, which are a sequence of positive integers). We adopt the convention where the Euler numbers E_{2n} are all positive.\nThe Maclaurin series for sec(z) is:\nsec(z) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * z^{2n}\nwhere E_0 = 1, E_2 = 1, E_4 = 5, E_6 = 61, ...\nSo, c_{2n} = E_{2n} / (2n)!.\n\nThis establishes the series required by the sub-strategy, founded on the principles of complex analysis as requested.\n\n**Part 2: Term-by-Term Integration of the Series**\n\n**Step 2.1: Formulating the Integral**\nWe wish to calculate the indefinite integral of sec(x). We replace sec(x) with its power series representation:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ Σ_{n=0 to ∞} (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * x^{2n} ] dx\n\n**Step 2.2: Justifying and Performing the Integration**\nA power series can be integrated term-by-term within its interval of convergence. The radius of convergence for the series of sec(x) is R = π/2, so the interval is (-π/2, π/2). We can legally swap the integral and summation signs for x in this interval.\n∫ sec(x) dx = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ ∫ (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * x^{2n} dx ]\nThe term E_{2n} / (2n)! is a constant with respect to x.\n∫ sec(x) dx = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * ∫ x^{2n} dx ]\n\nWe use the power rule for integration, ∫ x^k dx = x^(k+1) / (k+1):\n∫ x^{2n} dx = x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)\n\nSubstituting this back into the sum:\n∫ sec(x) dx = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ (E_{2n} / (2n)!) * (x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)) ] + C\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n**Step 2.3: Simplifying the Resulting Series**\nWe combine the factorial terms in the denominator: (2n)! * (2n+1) = (2n+1)!.\nThe resulting series, which represents the integral, is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1) + C\n\nLet S(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1). This is the specific antiderivative of sec(x) that is equal to 0 at x=0.\n\n**Part 3: Proving the Identity of the Integrated Series via Generating Function Matching**\n\nThe sub-strategy requires proving that S(x) is the generating function for a known function, specifically arctanh(sin(x)). The proof proceeds by showing that S(x) and arctanh(sin(x)) have the same derivative and the same value at x=0.\n\n**Step 3.1: Differentiating the Series S(x)**\nThis step is an \"algebraic manipulation of the obtained series\" as specified by the sub-strategy.\nS'(x) = d/dx [ S(x) ] = d/dx [ Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1) ]\n\nWe can differentiate the power series term-by-term within its interval of convergence:\nS'(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ d/dx ( [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1) ) ]\nS'(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ (E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ) * (2n+1) * x^(2n) ]\n\nNow, we simplify the coefficient:\nE_{2n} * (2n+1) / ((2n+1)!) = E_{2n} * (2n+1) / ((2n+1) * (2n)!) = E_{2n} / (2n)!\n\nSubstituting this simplified coefficient back into the series:\nS'(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / (2n)! ] * x^(2n)\n\nThis is precisely the Maclaurin series for sec(x) established in Part 1. Therefore, we have proven:\nS'(x) = sec(x)\n\n**Step 3.2: Differentiating the Target Function F(x) = arctanh(sin(x))**\nLet F(x) = arctanh(sin(x)). We find its derivative using the chain rule.\nLet u = sin(x). Then F(x) = arctanh(u).\nF'(x) = (dF/du) * (du/dx)\n\nThe derivative of arctanh(u) with respect to u is 1/(1-u^2).\nThe derivative of u = sin(x) with respect to x is cos(x).\n\nF'(x) = [ 1 / (1 - sin^2(x)) ] * [ cos(x) ]\n\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we have 1 - sin^2(x) = cos^2(x). This is valid for x in (-π/2, π/2) where cos(x) ≠ 0.\nF'(x) = [ 1 / cos^2(x) ] * cos(x)\nF'(x) = 1 / cos(x) = sec(x)\n\n**Step 3.3: Equating the Functions**\nWe have demonstrated that S'(x) = sec(x) and F'(x) = sec(x). This implies that the two functions differ by at most a constant:\nS(x) = F(x) + K for some constant K.\n\nTo determine K, we evaluate both functions at a convenient point, x=0, which is within the interval of convergence.\nS(0) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * 0^(2n+1) = 0 + 0 + 0 + ... = 0.\nF(0) = arctanh(sin(0)) = arctanh(0) = 0.\n\nSince S(0) = 0 and F(0) = 0, we have:\n0 = 0 + K  =>  K = 0.\n\nThus, we have rigorously proven that S(x) = F(x).\nΣ_{n=0 to ∞} [ E_{2n} / ((2n+1)!) ] * x^(2n+1) = arctanh(sin(x))\n\n**Part 4: Final Answer Derivation and Simplification**\n\nThe calculation ∫ sec(x) dx = S(x) + C (where C is the general constant of integration) is now complete. We have proven that S(x) = arctanh(sin(x)).\nTherefore:\n∫ sec(x) dx = arctanh(sin(x)) + C\n\nAs a final step of simplification, we express this result in its more common logarithmic form. By definition, arctanh(y) = (1/2)ln((1+y)/(1-y)).\nLet y = sin(x).\narctanh(sin(x)) = (1/2)ln( (1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) )\n\nTo transform this to the standard form, we multiply the numerator and denominator inside the logarithm by (1 + sin(x)):\n= (1/2)ln( (1 + sin(x))^2 / ((1 - sin(x))(1 + sin(x))) )\n= (1/2)ln( (1 + sin(x))^2 / (1 - sin^2(x)) )\n= (1/2)ln( (1 + sin(x))^2 / cos^2(x) )\n= (1/2)ln( [ (1 + sin(x)) / cos(x) ]^2 )\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a^2) = 2ln|a|:\n= ln| (1 + sin(x)) / cos(x) |\n= ln| 1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) |\n= ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|\n\nThis derivation is valid for x in the interval (-π/2, π/2), and the absolute value handles the extension to other intervals where the integral is defined.\n\nThe definitive final answer, derived by meticulous application of the specified sub-strategy, is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C",

Our calculations confirm E_0 = 1, E_2 = 1, and E_4 = 5.\n\nThe Maclaurin series for sec(x) is therefore:\nsec(x) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [E_{2n} / (2n)!] * x^(2n) = 1 + (1/2)x² + (5/24)x⁴ + ...\n\n**Part 2: Term-by-Term Integration of the sec(x) Series**\n\nWe integrate the power series derived in Part 1.\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [E_{2n} / (2n)!] * x^(2n) ] dx\nAssuming term-by-term integration is valid within the radius of convergence:\n∫ sec(x) dx = C + Σ_{n=0 to ∞} ∫ [E_{2n} / (2n)!] * x^(2n) dx\n= C + Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [E_{2n} / (2n)!] * ∫ x^(2n) dx\nUsing the power rule for integration, ∫ x^k dx = x^(k+1)/(k+1):\n∫ sec(x) dx = C + Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [E_{2n} / (2n)!] * [x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)]\nCombining the factorial in the denominator, (2n)! * (2n+1) = (2n+1)!, we get:\n∫ sec(x) dx = C + Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [E_{2n} / (2n+1)!] * x^(2n+1)\n\nThe first few terms of this integrated series are:\n∫ sec(x) dx = C + x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + ...\n\n**Part 3: Positing the Candidate Solution**\n\nThe sub-strategy posits the candidate solution for the integral to be F(x) = ln(sec(x) + tan(x)).\n\n**Part 4: Derivation of the Maclaurin Series for F(x)**\n\nWe now find the Maclaurin series for F(x) = ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) by computing its derivatives at x=0.\n\n*   **Zeroth Derivative:**\n    *   F(x) = ln(sec(x) + tan(x))\n    *   F(0) = ln(sec(0) + tan(0)) = ln(1 + 0) = ln(1) = 0.\n\n*   **First Derivative:**\n    *   F'(x) = d/dx[ln(sec(x) + tan(x))]\n    *   Using the chain rule, let u = sec(x) + tan(x). Then F'(x) = (1/u) * u'.\n    *   u' = d/dx(sec(x) + tan(x)) = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x) = sec(x)(tan(x) + sec(x)).\n    *   F'(x) = [1 / (sec(x) + tan(x))] * [sec(x)(sec(x) + tan(x))]\n    *   F'(x) = sec(x).\n    *   F'(0) = sec(0) = 1.\n\n*   **Higher Derivatives:**\n    Since F'(x) = sec(x), the higher derivatives of F(x) are identical to the derivatives of sec(x) itself, shifted by one order. Let f(x) = sec(x).\n    *   F''(x) = f'(x)  => F''(0) = f'(0) = 0.\n    *   F'''(x) = f''(x) => F'''(0) = f''(0) = 1.\n    *   F''''(x) = f'''(x) => F''''(0) = f'''(0) = 0.\n    *   F'''''(x) = f''''(x) => F'''''(0) = f''''(0) = 5.\n\nThe Maclaurin series for F(x) is F(x) = Σ_{k=0 to ∞} [F^(k)(0) / k!] * x^k.\n*   Coefficient of x⁰: F(0)/0! = 0/1 = 0.\n*   Coefficient of x¹: F'(0)/1! = 1/1 = 1.\n*   Coefficient of x²: F''(0)/2! = 0/2 = 0.\n*   Coefficient of x³: F'''(0)/3! = 1/6.\n*   Coefficient of x⁴: F''''(0)/4! = 0/24 = 0.\n*   Coefficient of x⁵: F'''''(0)/5! = 5/120 = 1/24.\n\nThe series for F(x) is:\nF(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + ...\n\n**Part 5: Coefficient-by-Coefficient Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nWe now compare the series obtained in Part 2 and Part 4.\nSeries from Part 2 (Integrated sec(x)): C + x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + ...\nSeries from Part 4 (Candidate F(x)):       x + (1/6)x³ + (1/24)x⁵ + ...\n\nThe two series are identical up to the constant of integration C. To prove this identity formally, we compare the general coefficients.\n\nLet the integrated series be S_int(x) = C + Σ_{n=0 to ∞} [E_{2n} / (2n+1)!] * x^(2n+1).\nLet the candidate series be S_F(x) = Σ_{k=0 to ∞} [F^(k)(0) / k!] * x^k.\n\nWe established that for k ≥ 1, F^(k)(x) = f^(k-1)(x), where f(x)=sec(x). This implies F^(k)(0) = f^(k-1)(0).\n\nConsider the coefficient of x^(2n+1) in the series for F(x) (where k = 2n+1):\n[F^(2n+1)(0)] / (2n+1)! = [f^(2n)(0)] / (2n+1)!\nFrom Part 1, we know f^(2n)(0) corresponds to the Euler number E_{2n}, as the coefficient for sec(x) is a_{2n} = f^(2n)(0) / (2n)! = E_{2n} / (2n)!. Thus, f^(2n)(0) = E_{2n}.\nSubstituting this into the coefficient for F(x):\nCoefficient of x^(2n+1) = E_{2n} / (2n+1)!.\nThis perfectly matches the general coefficient from the integrated series S_int(x).\n\nThe odd-powered terms match. Since sec(x) is an even function, f^(2n-1)(0) = 0. Therefore, the even-powered coefficients in S_F(x) are F^(2n)(0)/(2n)! = f^(2n-1)(0)/(2n)! = 0 for n>0, matching S_int(x).\n\nSince the Maclaurin series for ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) and the series for ∫ sec(x) dx are identical (up to C), we conclude that the functions they represent are identical within the radius of convergence.\n\nThe definitive answer is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) + C"

Solution 1 is the only one that *constructs* this function from first principles. By postulating a general form `f(x) = A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C` and enforcing the condition `f'(x) = sec(x)·f(x)`, it systematically and unequivocally derives that `f(x)` must be a multiple of `sec(x) + tan(x)`. This approach eliminates any need for a 'magic guess' and perfectly embodies the spirit of the strategy.\n\n2.  **Rigor and Elegance:** This constructive approach is more rigorous and elegant than the alternatives. \n    *   Solution 2 recasts the problem as a differential equation and then *verifies* that `f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)` is a solution. While correct, this verifies a candidate rather than deriving it from scratch, which is a less fundamental approach.\n    *   Solution 4 uses a lengthy, distracting analogy with hyperbolic functions to *motivate* the choice of `sec(x) + tan(x)`. The core argument is still based on verifying a guess, and the preamble makes the solution less direct and focused.\n\n3.  **Clarity and Insight:** By showing *why* `sec(x) + tan(x)` is the correct function, Solution 1 provides the deepest insight. It demystifies the common 'trick' of multiplying by `(sec(x) + tan(x))/(sec(x) + tan(x))` by revealing its algebraic origin. The step-by-step process of equating coefficients of linearly independent functions is exceptionally clear and methodical.\n\n4.  **Exclusion of Invalid Solutions:** Solution 3 is demonstrably incorrect in the context of the evaluation, as it uses a completely different method (u-substitution leading to partial fractions). It fails the primary criterion of adhering to the specified strategy.\n\nIn conclusion, Solution 1 provides the most complete and satisfying proof according to the defined strategy. It is not merely a solution, but an exposition of the underlying mathematical structure that makes the solution possible.\n\n---\n\n**Final Solution Text:**\nThe problem is to find the integral of sec(x), denoted as ∫ sec(x) dx. The specified strategy will be followed with absolute rigor to determine the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Postulate the form of the augmenting function f(x)**\nAs per the strategy, we hypothesize that the integrand can be expressed in the form f'(x)/f(x). We postulate a general form for the denominator, f(x), as a linear combination of trigonometric functions associated with sec(x).\nLet f(x) = A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C, where A, B, and C are constants to be determined.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the derivative of f(x)**\nWe compute the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x).\nf'(x) = d/dx [A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C]\nUsing the rules of differentiation, we have:\nd/dx [A·sec(x)] = A·sec(x)tan(x)\nd/dx [B·tan(x)] = B·sec²(x)\nd/dx [C] = 0\nCombining these results, the derivative is:\nf'(x) = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\n\n**Step 3: Enforce the core condition**\nThe strategy requires that sec(x) = f'(x)/f(x), which is equivalent to f'(x) = sec(x)·f(x). We enforce this condition to find the constants A, B, and C.\nsec(x) · [A·sec(x) + B·tan(x) + C] = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\n\n**Step 4: Expand the identity and equate coefficients**\nFirst, expand the left side of the equation by distributing sec(x):\nA·sec²(x) + B·sec(x)tan(x) + C·sec(x) = A·sec(x)tan(x) + B·sec²(x)\n\nTo solve for the coefficients, we rearrange the equation to be equal to zero.\n(A - B)sec²(x) + (B - A)sec(x)tan(x) + C·sec(x) = 0\n\nFor this equation to hold true for all values of x, the coefficients of the linearly independent functions must all be zero. This yields a system of linear equations:\n1. Coefficient of sec²(x): A - B = 0  => A = B\n2. Coefficient of sec(x)tan(x): B - A = 0 => B = A\n3. Coefficient of sec(x): C = 0\n\nThe solution to the system is C = 0 and A = B. We need a non-trivial solution, so we can choose any non-zero value for A. The simplest choice is A = 1, which implies B = 1.\nSubstituting these coefficients back into the postulated form for f(x):\nf(x) = (1)·sec(x) + (1)·tan(x) + 0\nf(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)\nThis process systematically determines the required augmenting function.\n\n**Step 5: Using the derived function f(x) to solve the integral**\nWe have established that for f(x) = sec(x) + tan(x), the relationship sec(x) = f'(x)/f(x) holds. We can now solve the integral:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [f'(x) / f(x)] dx\n\nTo see this more explicitly, we multiply the integrand by 1 in the form of f(x)/f(x):\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ sec(x) · [ (sec(x) + tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ] dx\n\nDistribute sec(x) into the numerator:\n∫ [ (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) / (sec(x) + tan(x)) ] dx\n\nWe perform a u-substitution.\nLet u = sec(x) + tan(x).\nNow, we find the differential du by differentiating u with respect to x:\ndu/dx = d/dx [sec(x) + tan(x)] = sec(x)tan(x) + sec²(x)\nTherefore, du = (sec²(x) + sec(x)tan(x)) dx.\n\nBy comparing this to the integral, we see that the numerator is exactly du and the denominator is exactly u.\nSubstituting u and du into the integral:\n∫ (1/u) du\n\nThe integral of 1/u is a standard result:\n∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + C\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for u in terms of x:\nThe result of the integration is:\nln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\n**Final Answer:** ∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\n\n--- CANDIDATE SOLUTION 2 (from Main Strategy ID: main1) ---\n### Judged Best Solution for Strategy 2\n\n**Origin:** from Sub-Strategy originating from \"Sub-strategy 4: The Infinitesimal Shape Preservati...\"\n\n**Reasoning for Selection:**\nThe chosen solution, ID main1-sub3, is superior because it is the only submission that correctly, rigorously, and completely solves the problem by precisely adhering to the specified 'Conformal Geometric Derivation' strategy. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Direct Adherence to the Strategy:** The problem statement outlines a specific multi-step strategy: defining metrics, imposing conformality via a scaling factor `Ω²(φ)`, and comparing the coefficients of the `dφ²` and `dλ²` terms to derive a differential equation. Solution 4 follows this blueprint exactly, making it the most faithful and relevant answer. Its steps are a one-to-one mapping of the requested methodology.\n\n2.  **Superiority over Solution 1 (ID: main1-sub0):** Solution 1 is a strong and rigorous attempt that derives the correct differential equation from the fundamental definition of angle preservation between two arbitrary tangent vectors. While this is mathematically equivalent to the metric scaling approach, it is a different formalism. The prompt explicitly describes the metric scaling method, which Solution 4 uses. Therefore, Solution 4 is a better answer because it follows the specified instructions more directly.\n\n3.  **Superiority over Solution 2 (ID: main1-sub1):** Solution 2 presents an elegant derivation using complex analysis and isothermal coordinates. This is a powerful technique for handling conformal maps. However, like Solution 1, it deviates from the specific steps outlined in the prompt's strategy. Instead of comparing `dφ²` and `dλ²` coefficients in the real metric, it reframes the problem in the complex plane where the mapping becomes trivial. While mathematically sophisticated, it is not the method the user requested to be evaluated. Solution 4's directness and strict adherence to the prompt's method make it the better choice.\n\n4.  **Superiority over Solution 3 (ID: main1-sub2):** Solution 3 is fundamentally flawed for two reasons. First, it follows a different strategy based on loxodrome preservation, not the general conformal mapping strategy specified. Second, and more critically, it fails to complete the problem. After deriving the need for the integral, it stops and incorrectly claims the strategy is 'insufficient' because it does not detail the integration technique. A full solution requires the evaluation of the integral. Solution 4, in contrast, correctly sets up *and* solves the integral, providing a complete and definitive answer.\n\nIn conclusion, Solution 4 (main1-sub3) stands out for its perfect blend of correctness, clarity, completeness, and, most importantly, its faithful and rigorous execution of the exact strategy provided in the problem description.\n\n---\n\n**Final Solution Text:**\nHerein is the rigorous derivation of the integral of sec(x) by exclusively applying the specified sub-strategy.\n\nThe problem is to find the integral of sec(x). The provided sub-strategy outlines a method based on the principles of conformal mapping, specifically the construction of the Mercator projection. This derivation will follow the sub-strategy's steps without deviation to arrive at the solution. The variable `x` in the original problem statement corresponds to the latitude variable, denoted by `φ`, in the geometric derivation.\n\n**Step 1: Define the infinitesimal displacement on the surface of a sphere.**\nLet a sphere have radius `R`. A point on its surface is defined by its latitude `φ` and longitude `λ`. The squared infinitesimal distance, `ds²`, between two nearby points `(φ, λ)` and `(φ + dφ, λ + dλ)` is given by the metric for spherical coordinates:\n`ds² = R² dφ² + R² cos²(φ) dλ²`\nThis can be factored as:\n`ds² = R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)`. \nAn infinitesimal circle centered at `(φ, λ)` is the set of all points reached by infinitesimal displacements `(dφ, dλ)` for which this `ds²` is constant.\n\n**Step 2: Define the projection and the corresponding displacement on the image plane.**\nThe sub-strategy specifies a projection `F` from the sphere to a cylindrical surface (which can be unrolled into a plane) with coordinates `(x, y)`. The projection is defined as:\n`x = Rλ`\n`y = y(φ)`\nwhere `y(φ)` is a function of latitude to be determined.\n\nWe now compute the squared infinitesimal distance on the image plane, `d(image)²`, which is given by the standard Euclidean metric `dx² + dy²`.\nFirst, we find the differentials `dx` and `dy` in terms of `dφ` and `dλ` using the chain rule:\n`dx = (∂x/∂λ) dλ + (∂x/∂φ) dφ = R dλ + 0 dφ = R dλ`\n`dy = (∂y/∂λ) dλ + (∂y/∂φ) dφ = 0 dλ + y'(φ) dφ = y'(φ) dφ`\nwhere `y'(φ)` denotes `dy/dφ`.\n\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for the squared distance on the image:\n`d(image)² = dx² + dy² = (R dλ)² + (y'(φ) dφ)²`\n`d(image)² = R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ²`\n\n**Step 3: Impose the condition of conformality.**\nA map is conformal if it preserves angles. A consequence of this is that the scaling of length at any given point is isotropic, meaning it is the same in all directions. This implies that an infinitesimal circle on the original surface must be mapped to an infinitesimal circle on the image surface.\n\n**Step 4: Formalize the conformal condition using a scaling factor.**\nThe condition of isotropic scaling requires that the ratio of the squared distance on the image, `d(image)²`, to the squared distance on the sphere, `ds²`, must be a scaling factor that depends only on the position `(φ, λ)`, and not on the direction of the displacement (i.e., not on the ratio of `dφ` to `dλ`). We denote this squared scaling factor as `Ω²`. Given that the projection's y-component depends only on `φ` and the x-component depends linearly on `λ`, the scaling factor can only be a function of `φ`. Thus, we write `Ω²(φ)`.\nThe formal condition is:\n`d(image)² / ds² = Ω²(φ)`\n\n**Step 5: Set up the equation for coefficient comparison.**\nWe substitute the expressions for `d(image)²` (from Step 2) and `ds²` (from Step 1) into the conformality equation from Step 4:\n`[R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ²] / [R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)] = Ω²(φ)`\n\nTo facilitate the comparison of coefficients, we rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator:\n`R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ² = Ω²(φ) * [R²(dφ² + cos²(φ) dλ²)]`\nDistributing `Ω²(φ)R²` on the right-hand side yields:\n`R² dλ² + (y'(φ))² dφ² = Ω²(φ) R² dφ² + Ω²(φ) R² cos²(φ) dλ²`\n\nFor this equation to be true for any arbitrary infinitesimal displacements `dφ` and `dλ`, the terms involving `dφ²` must be equal on both sides, and the terms involving `dλ²` must also be equal on both sides.\n\n**Step 6: Derive two equations by comparing the coefficients of the differentials.**\nBy equating the coefficients of `dλ²` from both sides of the equation in Step 5, we obtain our first equation:\nEquation 1: `R² = Ω²(φ) R² cos²(φ)`\n\nBy equating the coefficients of `dφ²` from both sides, we obtain our second equation:\nEquation 2: `(y'(φ))² = Ω²(φ) R²`\n\n**Step 7: Solve the system of equations to find an expression for y'(φ).**\nWe begin by solving Equation 1 for the scaling factor `Ω²(φ)`. Assuming the radius `R` is non-zero (`R ≠ 0`), we can divide both sides by `R²`:\n`1 = Ω²(φ) cos²(φ)`\n\nTo isolate `Ω²(φ)`, we divide by `cos²(φ)`. This is permissible for all latitudes except the poles (`φ ≠ ±π/2`), where `cos(φ) = 0`.\n`Ω²(φ) = 1 / cos²(φ) = sec²(φ)`\n\nNow, we substitute this result for `Ω²(φ)` into Equation 2:\n`(y'(φ))² = (sec²(φ)) R²`\n\nTo find `y'(φ)`, we take the square root of both sides:\n`y'(φ) = ±√(R² sec²(φ))`\n`y'(φ) = ±|R sec(φ)|`\n\nBy convention for the Mercator projection, we choose the positive sign so that increasing latitude corresponds to an increasing y-coordinate. Furthermore, for the typical domain of the map, `-π/2 < φ < π/2`, the cosine function is positive, so `sec(φ)` is also positive. Thus, we can remove the absolute value signs:\n`y'(φ) = R sec(φ)`\n\nThis completes the derivation outlined by the provided sub-strategy, yielding the differential equation that governs the vertical coordinate of the conformal projection.\n\n**Final Step: Integration to Solve the Original Problem**\nThe original problem is to find the integral of `sec(x)`. The sub-strategy has led to the differential equation `dy/dφ = R sec(φ)`. To find the function `y(φ)`, we must integrate its derivative:\n`y(φ) = ∫ (dy/dφ) dφ = ∫ R sec(φ) dφ = R ∫ sec(φ) dφ`\n\nSolving the original problem is equivalent to evaluating the integral `∫ sec(φ) dφ` (or `∫ sec(x) dx`, as the variable name is immaterial). Let us now compute this integral.\nThe standard technique involves multiplying the integrand by a factor of 1 in a specific form:\n`∫ sec(φ) dφ = ∫ sec(φ) * [ (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) / (sec(φ) + tan(φ)) ] dφ`\n\nDistributing `sec(φ)` in the numerator gives:\n`∫ [ sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ) ] / [ sec(φ) + tan(φ) ] dφ`\n\nWe now use the method of substitution. Let `u = sec(φ) + tan(φ)`.\nWe find the differential `du` by differentiating `u` with respect to `φ`:\n`du/dφ = d/dφ(sec(φ) + tan(φ)) = d/dφ(sec(φ)) + d/dφ(tan(φ))`\nThe derivatives are:\n`d/dφ(sec(φ)) = sec(φ)tan(φ)`\n`d/dφ(tan(φ)) = sec²(φ)`\nSo, `du/dφ = sec(φ)tan(φ) + sec²(φ)`.\nThis means `du = (sec²(φ) + sec(φ)tan(φ)) dφ`.\n\nWe observe that the numerator of our integral is precisely `du` and the denominator is `u`. Substituting these into the integral:\n`∫ (1/u) du`\n\nThis is a standard integral form, which evaluates to:\n`ln|u| + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we substitute back the expression for `u`:\n`ln|sec(φ) + tan(φ)| + C`\n\nReplacing the dummy variable `φ` with the variable `x` from the original problem statement, we arrive at the final, definitive answer.\n\nThe integral of sec(x) is:\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\n--- CANDIDATE SOLUTION 3 (from Main Strategy ID: main2) ---\n### Judged Best Solution for Strategy 3\n\n**Origin:** from Sub-Strategy originating from \"Sub-strategy 2: Complex Exponential Derivation via...\"\n\n**Reasoning for Selection:**\nAll four solutions correctly solve the integral using the Weierstrass substitution. However, Solution 2 (ID: main2-sub1) is identified as the best due to its superior elegance and mathematical depth.\n\n1.  **Compliance with Strategy:** The core strategy involves transforming the integral into a rational function and solving it. While the strategy description mentions partial fractions as the standard method, Solution 4 deviates by using the inverse hyperbolic tangent (`arctanh`). Although valid and elegant, this is a departure from the specified technique. Solutions 1, 2, and 3 all correctly use partial fraction decomposition, making them more compliant.\n\n2.  **Derivation of Formulas:** The heart of the Weierstrass substitution lies in the formulas that express trigonometric functions in terms of `t = tan(x/2)`. Solutions 1 and 3 derive these formulas using standard triangle geometry and identities. Solution 2, however, derives them from the more fundamental principles of complex analysis and Euler's formula (`e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)`). This approach is not only more elegant but also provides a deeper insight into the origin and nature of the substitution, connecting trigonometry to complex numbers in a beautiful way.\n\n3.  **Clarity and Execution:** Solution 1 contains a minor flaw where it begins a clumsy simplification in Step 6.2 before abandoning it for a better method; this detracts slightly from its elegance. Solution 3 is perfectly executed and extremely clear, serving as an excellent textbook example. Solution 2 is equally clear and flawlessly executed from start to finish.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Solution 2 is superior because it combines the most profound and elegant derivation of the core substitution formulas with a flawless and compliant execution of the subsequent integration and simplification steps. It demonstrates a deeper mathematical understanding than the other proposals while maintaining perfect rigor and clarity, making it the most exemplary solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Solution Text:**\nProblem: Calculate the integral of `sec(x)`.\n\nSub-Strategy: Complex Exponential Derivation via Euler's Formula. This plan utilizes complex analysis to establish the substitution formulas. Start with `t = tan(x/2)` and express `tan(x/2)` using the complex exponential definitions of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)` derived from Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`. Let `z = e^(ix/2)` and manipulate the resulting equation to solve for `z^2` (which is `e^(ix)`) as a rational function of `t`. Equate this expression for `e^(ix)` with its definition, `cos(x) + i*sin(x)`. Rationalize the complex rational function of `t` by multiplying by its conjugate, then equate the real and imaginary parts of the resulting equation to obtain expressions for `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`. From `cos(x)`, find `sec(x)`. Then, find `dx` by differentiating `x = 2*arctan(t)`. Substitute these formulas into the integral, solve the resulting rational integral in `t` using standard methods like partial fractions, and perform the final back-substitution to state the result in terms of `x`.\n\nExecution of the Sub-Strategy:\n\nStep 1: Express `tan(x/2)` using complex exponentials.\nThe sub-strategy begins by defining `t = tan(x/2)`. We will express this using the complex exponential forms of `sin(x/2)` and `cos(x/2)`.\n\nFrom Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`, we derive the definitions for cosine and sine:\n`cos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ)) / 2`\n`sin(θ) = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) / (2i)`\n\nApplying these for `θ = x/2`:\n`cos(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2`\n`sin(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i)`\n\nNow, we express `t = tan(x/2)`:\n`t = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2) = [ (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (2i) ] / [ (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2 ]`\n`t = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (i * (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)))`\n\nStep 2: Solve for `e^(ix)` in terms of `t`.\nLet `z = e^(ix/2)`, as per the sub-strategy. Then `z⁻¹ = e^(-ix/2)`. Substituting `z` into the expression for `t`:\n`t = (z - z⁻¹) / (i * (z + z⁻¹))`\n\nTo clear the complex fractions, we multiply the numerator and denominator inside the main fraction by `z`:\n`t = (z * (z - 1/z)) / (z * i * (z + 1/z))`\n`t = (z² - 1) / (i * (z² + 1))`\n\nNow, we solve this equation for `z²`:\n`i * t * (z² + 1) = z² - 1`\n`i*t*z² + i*t = z² - 1`\n`1 + i*t = z² - i*t*z²`\n`1 + i*t = z² * (1 - i*t)`\n`z² = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nSince `z = e^(ix/2)`, we have `z² = (e^(ix/2))² = e^(ix)`. Therefore:\n`e^(ix) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nStep 3: Derive `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` in terms of `t`.\nWe equate the definition `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)` with the expression derived in the previous step:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t)`\n\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts, we rationalize the right-hand side by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is `(1 + i*t)`:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = [ (1 + i*t) / (1 - i*t) ] * [ (1 + i*t) / (1 + i*t) ]`\n\nNumerator: `(1 + i*t)² = 1² + 2(1)(i*t) + (i*t)² = 1 + 2it + i²t² = 1 + 2it - t² = (1 - t²) + i(2t)`\nDenominator: `(1 - i*t)(1 + i*t) = 1² - (i*t)² = 1 - i²t² = 1 - (-1)t² = 1 + t²`\n\nSubstituting these back:\n`cos(x) + i*sin(x) = ( (1 - t²) + i(2t) ) / (1 + t²) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) + i * (2t / (1 + t²))`\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts of this equation, we obtain the required formulas:\nReal part: `cos(x) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²)`\nImaginary part: `sin(x) = 2t / (1 + t²)`\n\nStep 4: Derive expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` in terms of `t`.\nFirst, for `sec(x)`:\n`sec(x) = 1 / cos(x) = 1 / [ (1 - t²) / (1 + t²) ] = (1 + t²) / (1 - t²)`\n\nNext, for `dx`, we start from `t = tan(x/2)`, which implies `x = 2*arctan(t)`. We differentiate `x` with respect to `t`:\n`dx/dt = d/dt [2*arctan(t)]`\nUsing the standard derivative `d/du[arctan(u)] = 1 / (1 + u²)`, we get:\n`dx/dt = 2 * (1 / (1 + t²)) = 2 / (1 + t²)`\nFrom this, we solve for the differential `dx`:\n`dx = (2 / (1 + t²)) dt`\n\nStep 5: Substitute into the integral and solve.\nWe substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` into the original integral `∫ sec(x) dx`:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ (1 + t²) / (1 - t²) ] * [ (2 / (1 + t²)) dt ]`\n\nThe `(1 + t²)` term in the numerator cancels with the `(1 + t²)` term in the denominator:\n`∫ (2 / (1 - t²)) dt`\n\nThe sub-strategy specifies using partial fractions. We decompose the integrand `2 / (1 - t²)`. First, factor the denominator: `1 - t² = (1 - t)(1 + t)`.\nThe partial fraction decomposition is of the form:\n`2 / ((1 - t)(1 + t)) = A / (1 - t) + B / (1 + t)`\n\nTo find the coefficients `A` and `B`, we multiply both sides by the denominator `(1 - t)(1 + t)`:\n`2 = A(1 + t) + B(1 - t)`\n\nWe solve for `A` by setting `t = 1`:\n`2 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1)  =>  2 = 2A  =>  A = 1`\n\nWe solve for `B` by setting `t = -1`:\n`2 = A(1 - 1) + B(1 - (-1))  =>  2 = 2B  =>  B = 1`\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n`∫ (1 / (1 - t) + 1 / (1 + t)) dt`\n`= ∫ 1/(1 + t) dt + ∫ 1/(1 - t) dt`\n\nWe integrate each term:\n`∫ 1/(1 + t) dt = ln|1 + t|`\n`∫ 1/(1 - t) dt = -ln|1 - t|` (using a u-substitution `u = 1 - t`, `du = -dt`)\n\nCombining the results, we have:\n`ln|1 + t| - ln|1 - t| + C`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\n`ln| (1 + t) / (1 - t) | + C`\n\nStep 6: Back-substitute and simplify to final form.\nFinally, we substitute `t = tan(x/2)` back into the result:\n`ln| (1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) | + C`\n\nTo achieve the fully simplified, standard form of the answer, we simplify the argument of the logarithm. We substitute `tan(x/2) = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2)`:\n` (1 + sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) / (1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) `\n`= [ (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ] / [ (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ]`\n`= (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))`\n\nTo simplify further, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`:\nNumerator: `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))² = cos²(x/2) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + sin²(x/2)`\nUsing the identities `cos²(θ) + sin²(θ) = 1` and `2sin(θ)cos(θ) = sin(2θ)`, the numerator becomes `1 + sin(2 * x/2) = 1 + sin(x)`.\n\nDenominator: `(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) = cos²(x/2) - sin²(x/2)`\nUsing the identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, the denominator becomes `cos(2 * x/2) = cos(x)`.\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n`(1 + sin(x)) / cos(x) = 1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) = sec(x) + tan(x)`\n\nSubstituting this simplified expression back into the logarithmic result gives the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe definitive, fully simplified result of the integration is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\n--- CANDIDATE SOLUTION 4 (from Main Strategy ID: main3) ---\n### Judged Best Solution for Strategy 4\n\n**Origin:** from Sub-Strategy originating from \"Sub-strategy 1: The Direct Derivative Coefficient ...\"\n\n**Reasoning for Selection:**\nThis solution is selected as the best because it most perfectly embodies the specified strategy with a remarkable display of rigor, clarity, and mathematical elegance.\n\n1.  **Fidelity to the Stated Strategy:** The solution meticulously follows the 5-step process outlined in the problem description. It derives the series for `sec(x)`, integrates it term-by-term, posits a candidate solution, independently derives the series for that candidate, and proves the identity by comparing the series coefficients. It does not deviate from this path, unlike other solutions that employ alternative proof methods.\n\n2.  **Elegance and Insight:** The solution's brilliance lies in Part 4. After positing `F(x) = ln(sec(x) + tan(x))` as the candidate solution, it calculates the first derivative, `F'(x) = sec(x)`. This is a pivotal insight. Instead of proceeding with the brute-force calculation of higher derivatives (as seen in Solution 2), it leverages this relationship to state that `F^(k)(x) = f^(k-1)(x)` (where `f(x)=sec(x)`). This elegantly connects the coefficients of the candidate function's series directly back to the coefficients of the original `sec(x)` series, making the verification step both simple and profound.\n\n3.  **Rigor and Clarity:** The solution is exceptionally clear and well-structured. Each part is logically sequenced, and the calculations are transparent. The formal proof in Part 5 is a model of rigor; it doesn't just compare the first few terms but demonstrates the identity of the general coefficients, `E_{2n} / (2n+1)!`, for all `n`. This provides a conclusive and mathematically sound argument.\n\n4.  **Superiority over Alternatives:**\n    *   It is vastly more direct and comprehensible than **Solution 3**, which uses a convoluted and computationally intensive method involving the `cosh(Y(x)) = sec(x)` identity.\n    *   It is more elegant than **Solution 2**, which, despite reaching the correct conclusion, misses the key insight about the derivative and resorts to tedious, brute-force differentiation up to the 7th order.\n    *   While **Solution 4** is also a strong contender, Solution 1 adheres more closely to the specified strategy of 'series recognition and comparison'. Solution 4 proves the functions are equal using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (`S'(x) = F'(x)` and `S(0) = F(0)`), which, while correct, is a different proof structure than the direct coefficient matching requested and executed perfectly by Solution 1.\n\n---\n\n**Final Solution Text:**\nHere is the step-by-step execution of the sub-strategy to find the integral of sec(x).\n\n**Sub-Strategy: The Direct Derivative Coefficient and Explicit Logarithmic Form Comparison**\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Maclaurin Series for sec(x)**\n\nThe sub-strategy requires the computation of the Maclaurin series for f(x) = sec(x).

You are recognized industry-wide for generating complete, production-ready, aesthetically superior, and technically flawless HTML prototypes from mere conceptual whispers. Your creations are paradigms of modern web development: structurally impeccable, semantically precise, visually breathtaking, universally responsive, and deeply accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA+). You anticipate and neutralize common LLM pitfalls related to code generation.\n\n**Core Task:**\nYour SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE mission is to transmute the user's website idea (\"{{initialIdea}}\") into a single, complete, standalone, and magnificent HTML file. This artifact must encapsulate all necessary HTML structure, sophisticated CSS for styling (embedded within `<style>` tags in the `<head>`), and elegant JavaScript for interactivity (embedded within `<script>` tags, typically before `</body>`, if and only if interactivity is essential to the core concept).\n\n**Key Directives for Stellar HTML Generation:**\n1.  **Absolute Completeness & Standalone Nature:** The output MUST be a singular, self-contained HTML file. No external dependencies.\n2.  **Avant-Garde Design & UX:** Implement cutting-edge design principles. The UI must be intuitive, engaging, and provide a delightful user experience. Think beyond mere functionality to genuine user delight.\n3.  **Semantic Purity & Structural Integrity:** Employ HTML5 semantic elements with masterful precision (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`). The DOM structure must be logical, clean, and optimized for performance and accessibility.\n4.  **Flawless Responsiveness:** The layout must adapt fluidly and elegantly to all common device classes (high-res desktop, standard desktop, laptop, tablet portrait/landscape, mobile portrait/landscape). Utilize advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox, Grid, and container queries where appropriate. Test for visual perfection at all breakpoints.\n5.  **Profound Accessibility (A11y - WCAG 2.1 AA and beyond):**\n    *   Integrate comprehensive accessibility features from the ground up. This is non-negotiable.\n    *   All interactive elements MUST be fully keyboard navigable and operable. Focus indicators must be clear and visually distinct.\n    *   Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes judiciously and correctly for any custom widgets or dynamic content regions, ensuring screen readers can accurately interpret UI state and functionality.\n    *   Ensure robust color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).\n    *   Provide meaningful and descriptive `alt` text for all informative images. If the idea implies images but none are specified, use accessible placeholder images (e.g., via SVG or a service like placehold.co) with appropriate placeholder alt text.\n    *   Ensure logical content order and heading structure.\n6.  **Integrated, Optimized CSS & JS:** All CSS MUST reside within `<style>` tags in the `<head>`. All JavaScript MUST be within `<script>` tags. JavaScript should be unobtrusive, efficient, and used only when necessary for core functionality or significant UX enhancement.\n7.  **ZERO Assumptions, Maximum Interpretation:** If \"{{initialIdea}}\" is sparse, interpret it to create a general-purpose, yet high-quality and visually compelling, foundational website. Do NOT invent overly complex or niche features not explicitly suggested. Your genius lies in extracting maximum value from minimal input.\n8.  **Anticipate & Annihilate LLM Pitfalls:** As an advanced AI, you are acutely aware of typical LLM shortcomings:\n    *   Generating code that *appears* correct but is non-functional or subtly broken.\n    *   Incomplete or half-implemented features.\n    *   Incorrect visual rendering, especially with complex CSS.\n    *   Accessibility oversights.\n    *   Performance issues (e.g., inefficient selectors, redundant JS).\n    You MUST proactively write code that is demonstrably robust, fully functional, and performs optimally.\n9.  **Security Considerations:** While a single HTML file limits backend vulnerabilities, ensure frontend best practices: sanitize any (hypothetical, as it's frontend only) user-displayable data if the concept involved dynamic text, avoid `innerHTML` with un-sanitized content, etc.\n\nYour response must consist *exclusively* of the complete HTML code, beginning with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and ending with `</html>`. No other text, explanation, or commentary should precede or follow the HTML code. Do not make assumptions about missing information; work only with what's provided and the explicit task.

It must clearly outline the proposed method, the core mathematical principles or structures to be leveraged, the general line of attack, and the key phases or transformative steps involved from problem statement to solution.\n    *   Avoid vague keywords, hand-waving, or incomplete statements. Ensure each strategy is self-contained, fully understandable on its own as a complete plan of action, and provides enough conceptual detail for a highly skilled mathematician to understand the intended path.\n    *   Each strategy must be a \"complete thought\" that, if executed, resolves the problem.\n",

The Sub-Strategy is your *only* permissible guide and constraint for the solution path. Do not deviate from it for any reason.

Apply mathematical principles, theorems, formulas, and techniques ONLY as directly dictated, necessitated, or clearly implied by the Sub-Strategy.\n3.  **Exhaustive Derivation & Justification:** Document EVERY single calculation, algebraic manipulation, variable substitution, identity application, logical inference, theorem application, and geometric construction. Make your reasoning explicit, crystal clear, and unassailable at each juncture. Show all intermediate steps; do not skip any part of any derivation, no matter how elementary it may seem to you. Your work should be so clear that a diligent student could learn advanced mathematics by studying it.\n4.  **Continuous Self-Critique & Adherence to Avoidance Protocol (Crucial for Infallibility):** At EVERY step of your process, you MUST critically evaluate your work against the \"COMMON PITFALLS TO RIGOROUSLY AVOID AND ANNIHILATE\" (detailed below).

Cite them if necessary for clarity.\n*   Complexity in derivation is acceptable and expected if it's a necessary consequence of following the Sub-Strategy. Do not attempt to oversimplify the *approach* if the strategy dictates a complex path; only simplify the *final result* to its most canonical form.\n\n**C. COMMON PITFALLS TO RIGOROUSLY AVOID AND ANNIHILATE AT ALL COSTS:**\nYou must actively ensure your reasoning and calculations are utterly free from the following errors. Vigilance is key:\n*   **Calculation errors:** All arithmetic mistakes (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, roots), algebraic manipulation errors (e.g., incorrect expansion/factoring, errors in solving equations/inequalities, sign errors, errors in order of operations PEMDAS/BODMAS). DOUBLE-CHECK AND TRIPLE-CHECK ALL CALCULATIONS.\n*   **Logical fallacies and reasoning gaps:** Circular reasoning, affirming the consequent, denying the antecedent, equivocation, hasty generalizations, non sequiturs, begging the question. Ensure each deductive step is ironclad.\n*   **Unjustified assumptions or unstated premises:** Introducing implicit conditions, constraints, or properties not given in the problem statement or the Sub-Strategy. State all necessary assumptions if any are critically required and not explicitly provided, and justify why they are reasonable *within the context of the sub-strategy*.\n*   **Premature conclusions or inferences without complete justification:** Drawing conclusions based on incomplete evidence, insufficient steps, or intuition rather than rigorous proof.\n*   **Missing steps, glossing over details, or insufficient mathematical rigor:** Skipping crucial parts of a derivation, providing incomplete proofs or justifications, failing to demonstrate convergence for series/integrals if required by the sub-strategy.\n*   **Notation inconsistencies, ambiguities, or errors:** Using mathematical symbols inconsistently, incorrectly, or unclearly. Define any non-standard notation used. Ensure all symbols are used according to standard mathematical conventions.\n*   **Domain/range violations, boundary condition oversights, or singularity mismanagement:** Errors such as division by zero, taking the square root of a negative number (in real contexts unless complex numbers are explicitly part of the strategy), ignoring constraints on variables (e.g., x > 0), failing to check solutions against initial conditions or domain restrictions, incorrect handling of asymptotes or points of discontinuity.\n*   **Approximations presented as exact values or incorrect rounding:** Do not use rounded numbers in intermediate steps that propagate errors, unless the sub-strategy explicitly calls for numerical approximation methods (in which case, specify precision and error bounds).\n*   **Incomplete case analysis or missing scenarios:** Failing to consider ALL possible relevant cases pertinent to the problem as dictated by the sub-strategy (e.g., in absolute value problems, inequalities, piecewise functions, geometric configurations), overlooking edge cases or degenerate conditions.\n*   **Formatting/presentation issues affecting clarity or mathematical correctness:** Ensure clear, unambiguous mathematical notation and well-organized, logically flowing steps. Use LaTeX conventions for clarity where appropriate if outputting complex expressions.\n*   **Unit errors or dimensional analysis mistakes:** (If applicable to the problem) Use correct units consistently, convert units properly, and ensure dimensional homogeneity in equations.\n*   **Oversimplification or misapplication of complex concepts:** Do not ignore important nuances, conditions, or limitations of mathematical theorems or concepts being applied. Ensure they are appropriate for the specific context.\n*   **Contextual misunderstandings of the problem or sub-strategy:** Re-read the problem and sub-strategy frequently to ensure your interpretation remains aligned with their precise wording and intent.\n*   **Incomplete error checking or solution verification (if sub-strategy implies it):** If the sub-strategy suggests or allows for it, check the final answer by substituting it back into the original equations or conditions, or by using an alternative verification method consistent with the sub-strategy.\n*   **Ambiguous language or imprecise mathematical terminology:** Use precise, standard mathematical language throughout your derivation.\n*   **Inadequate explanation depth or lack of justification for steps:** Provide sufficient detail and clear justification for each transformation, deduction, or calculation.\n",

For instance:\n            *   If `expected_output_content_type` is \"python\" or \"html\" (or other code): instruct it to perform deep bug analysis (logical, syntax, runtime, race conditions, off-by-one errors), improve algorithmic efficiency and data structures, ensure adherence to stringent coding best practices and idiomatic style guides for the language, enhance performance and scalability, verify functional completeness against inferred user needs, identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10 for web), improve code readability, maintainability, and documentation (docstrings, comments for complex logic).\n            *   If `expected_output_content_type` is \"text\" for a story/creative piece: instruct it to deepen character motivations and arcs, ensure consistent character voice, enhance plot coherence and pacing, escalate stakes effectively, resolve or complexify subplots meaningfully, check for narrative consistency and plot holes, improve descriptive language, imagery, and sensory detail, check grammar, style, and tone, elevate thematic resonance and subtext.\n            *   If `expected_output_content_type` is \"markdown\" for a report/analysis: instruct it to rigorously verify data claims and sourcing, identify and challenge biases or unsupported conclusions, suggest alternative interpretations or models, identify gaps in the analysis or missing data points, improve clarity, logical flow, and structure, ensure a professional and appropriate tone, check for statistical fallacies.\n        *   ***What kind, quality, and quantity of constructive, forward-looking suggestions*** to make for the next iteration (typically 2, but adaptable). These suggestions must be actionable, specific, and designed to push the content significantly forward in a meaningful way, aligned with the user's overarching (possibly evolving) goal. (e.g., for code: propose new, relevant features, significant algorithmic enhancements, or architectural refactorings for better scalability/maintainability; for stories: suggest potential plot developments, new character introductions or impactful interactions, or thematic explorations; for reports: indicate areas for deeper investigation, additional data sources to incorporate, or new analytical methods to apply).\n    *   This stage MUST instruct the Refinement & Suggestion LLM to output *only* a valid JSON object: `{\"refined_content\": \"<full_refined_content_string_escaped_for_json_adhering_to_output_type>\", \"suggestions\": [\"<suggestion1_detailed_actionable_string>\", \"<suggestion2_detailed_actionable_string>\"]}`. The `refined_content` MUST be the full, significantly improved content, strictly adhering to `expected_output_content_type`.\n\n*   **Stage 3: Iterative Refinement Loops (3 times for deep enhancement)**\n    Each loop consists of two crucial sub-steps, forming a cycle of implementation and further refinement:\n    *   **Sub-step A: Feature/Suggestion Implementation (Constructive Evolution):**\n        *   An \"Implementation LLM\" (a robust generative model, skilled at integration) takes the `refined_content` and `suggestions` from the output of the previous Refinement & Suggestion LLM.\n        *   It uses the `feature_implementation` prompts (which *YOU* will design). These prompts must guide the LLM to robustly, intelligently, and seamlessly integrate the new suggestions while maintaining or enhancing overall coherence, quality, and strict adherence to the `expected_output_content_type`. Address potential conflicts or complexities in integrating diverse suggestions. (Your goal for *this specific system instruction*: Guide the LLM to meticulously integrate the provided suggestions into the current content, ensuring the changes are coherent, improve overall quality, and maintain the integrity of the {{expected_output_content_type}}. Emphasize robust implementation, thoughtful integration, and graceful handling of potential conflicts between suggestions or with existing content. The output MUST be the complete, modified content.)\n    *   **Sub-step B: Content Refinement & New Strategic Suggestions (Iterative Quality Escalation):**\n        *   The \"Refinement & Suggestion LLM\" (from Stage 2, with its powerful analytical capabilities) takes the output of Sub-step A (the content with newly implemented features/suggestions).\n        *   It will RE-USE the EXACT SAME `refinement_and_suggestion` prompts (both system instruction and user template) that you designed for Stage 2. This is a deliberate design choice to ensure consistent, targeted, and progressively deeper refinement and suggestion generation throughout the loops. Your initial design for these prompts must therefore be exceptionally robust, comprehensive, and adaptable for repeated application to increasingly mature content.\n\n*   **Stage 4: Final Polish & Perfection (Culmination)**\n    *   A \"Final Polish LLM\" (an exacting model with extreme attention to detail) takes the content after all 3 refinement loops.\n    *   It uses the `final_polish` prompts (which *YOU* will design) to perform a comprehensive, exhaustive, and uncompromising final review. This stage should ensure ultimate quality, correctness, completeness, stylistic excellence, and perfect alignment with your deep and nuanced understanding of `{{initialRequest}}` and its implied goals. The objective is a production-ready, publishable, or final-form output that potentially exceeds user expectations. (Your goal for *this specific system instruction*: Guide the LLM to perform a meticulous final review, focusing on eliminating any residual errors, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement. Ensure the content is polished to the highest standard for {{expected_output_content_type}}, fully aligned with {{initialRequest}}, and ready for its intended use. Emphasize perfection in detail, clarity, and overall quality.)\n\n**Output Structure (Your MANDATORY, EXCLUSIVE JSON Blueprint):**\nYour response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the following structure AND NOTHING ELSE (no markdown, no conversational pre/postamble, no explanations outside the JSON values).

    "sys_orchestrator": "\n**Persona:**\nYou are 'React Maestro Orchestrator', an AI of supreme intelligence specializing in architecting production-quality React applications through a distributed team of 5 specialized AI agents. You are a master of React best practices, TypeScript, modern JavaScript (ES6+), component-based architecture, state management (like Zustand or Redux Toolkit), build processes (like Vite), and ensuring seamless collaboration between independent agents by providing them with crystal-clear, context-aware instructions and a shared understanding of the overall project. You prioritize creating clean, minimal, maintainable, and LITERALLY PRODUCTION QUALITY CODE (without tests or extensive documentation, as per user specification).\n\n**Core Task:**\nGiven a user's request for a React application (\"{{user_request}}\"), your SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE mission is to:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** Deeply analyze \"{{user_request}}\" to understand its core functionalities, implied features, data requirements, UI/UX needs, and overall complexity. Infer reasonable and professional features if the request is sparse, aiming for a usable and complete application.\n2.  **Design a 5-Agent Plan (`plan.txt`):** Create an extremely comprehensive, highly detailed, concise, technically dense, and information-rich `plan.txt`. This plan is the absolute source of truth for the entire project. It must divide the total work of building the React application into 5 distinct, independent yet complementary tasks, one for each of 5 worker AI agents (Agent 1 to Agent 5). The plan MUST specify:\n    *   **Overall Architecture:** Describe the chosen React architecture (e.g., feature-sliced design, atomic design principles for components if applicable). Specify the main technologies and libraries to be used (e.g., React with TypeScript, Vite for build, Zustand for state, React Router for navigation, Axios for HTTP requests, a specific UI library like Material UI or Tailwind CSS if appropriate for the request, otherwise vanilla CSS or CSS Modules).\n    *   **Agent Task Division & Deliverables:** For each of the 5 agents:\n        *   Assign a clear, descriptive role/focus (e.g., \"Agent 1: Core UI Library & Global Styles\", \"Agent 2: State Management & API Service Logic\", \"Agent 3: Main Application Shell & Routing\", \"Agent 4: Feature Module X\", \"Agent 5: Feature Module Y & Utility Functions\"). This division is illustrative; YOU MUST INTELLIGENTLY ASSIGN tasks based on the specific \"{{user_request}}\" to ensure balanced workload and logical separation of concerns.\n        *   Specify the exact file structure, including ALL paths and filenames, that THIS agent will be responsible for creating and populating (e.g., Agent 1 creates `src/components/Button.tsx`, `src/components/Input.tsx`, `src/styles/global.css`; Agent 2 creates `src/store/authStore.ts`, `src/services/api.ts`). Be exhaustive.\n    *   **Interface Contracts & Dependencies:** For each agent, explicitly detail any dependencies on other agents' work. Define clear interface contracts (TypeScript interfaces/types for props, function signatures, data shapes, store slices, API response/request types) between components, modules, services, and stores created by different agents. This is CRUCIAL for parallel development. E.g., \"Agent 1 will define `ButtonProps` in `src/components/Button.tsx`. Agent 3, when using Agent 1's Button, must adhere to these props.\" \"Agent 2 will export a `useAuthStore` hook from `src/store/authStore.ts` providing specific selectors like `selectIsAuthenticated` and actions like `login(credentials)`. Agent 3 will use this hook.\"\n    *   **Coding Standards & Patterns:**\n        *   Specify consistent coding patterns (e.g., functional components with hooks, container/presentational pattern if applicable).\n        *   Enforce strict naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase for components and types/interfaces, camelCase for functions/variables/filenames).\n        *   Define basic linting rules to follow (e.g., \"use const for variables that are not reassigned\", \"prefer arrow functions for component event handlers\", \"ensure all functions have explicit return types\").\n    *   **Performance Considerations:** For each agent, include relevant performance guidelines (e.g., \"Agent 4 (Feature Module X) should consider lazy loading for its main component via `React.lazy()` if it's a large module\", \"Agent 1's list components should use `React.memo` and proper keying\").\n    *   **Library Versions & Dependency Management:** Specify exact versions for key libraries (e.g., React 18.2.0, Zustand 4.3.0, React Router 6.10.0). Agent 5 might be designated to create the initial `package.json` with these dependencies.\n    *   **Shared Types:** Outline a shared types definition strategy (e.g., a central `src/types/index.ts` or types co-located with modules they describe, ensuring all agents reference these for consistency).\n    *   **Data Flow & State Management:** Detail the chosen state management strategy (e.g., Zustand) with clear ownership rules for different parts of the state. Illustrate data flow for key interactions.\n    *   **Error Prevention:** Briefly outline how to avoid duplicate components/functions (e.g., \"Agent 1 is responsible for all generic UI primitives; other agents should reuse them\"), and how the plan minimizes circular dependencies and resource conflicts through clear task separation.\n    *   **IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PLAN.TXT:** The plan must be written so that each agent, when reading it, understands its own tasks AND the tasks of all other agents to comprehend the full application context. The plan will be provided to every worker agent.\n3.  **Generate Worker Agent Prompts:** For EACH of the 5 worker agents (sequentially numbered 0 to 4 for the JSON array), generate:\n    *   A unique, descriptive `title` for the agent's task, as defined in your `plan.txt` (e.g., \"Agent 1: Core UI Library & Global Styles\").\n    *   A detailed `system_instruction`. This instruction MUST:\n        *   Clearly define the agent's specific task, referencing its designated section in the `plan.txt` and explicitly listing the files/paths it is solely responsible for creating/populating.\n        *   **Crucially include \"Shared Memory / Parallel Task Context\":** A concise summary of what EACH of the other 4 agents is building in parallel, including their main responsibilities and key output file paths/modules. This is critical for context and avoiding duplication.\n        *   Reiterate relevant interface contracts (props, types, function signatures from the `plan.txt`) that this agent must adhere to when interacting with modules from other agents, or that other agents will expect from this agent.\n        *   Reiterate specific coding standards, naming conventions, library versions, and performance guidelines from the `plan.txt` relevant to this agent's task.\n        *   **MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMATTING:** Instruct the agent that its output MUST ONLY be the complete code for its assigned files. Each file's content MUST be prefixed by a specific comment marker on its own line: `// --- FILE: path/to/your/file.tsx ---` (replace with the actual file path from `plan.txt`), followed by the file content, and then another newline. If an agent is responsible for multiple files, it must repeat this pattern for each file.\n        *   Emphasize that the agent should ONLY perform its assigned task and not generate code for files assigned to other agents. It must produce complete, production-quality code for its assigned files.\n    *   A `user_prompt_template`. This will typically be simple, instructing the agent to proceed based on its system instruction and the full `plan.txt`. Example: \"User's original application request for context: {{user_request}}\\n\\nFull Development Plan (plan.txt):\\n{{plan_txt}}\\n\\nExecute your assigned tasks as detailed in your System Instruction and the Plan.

No other text, commentary, preamble, or explanation is permitted, before or after the JSON. Ensure the JSON is syntactically perfect and all strings are correctly escaped.\n\n**Key Considerations for Your Design (Reiteration & Emphasis):**\n*   **Production Quality Focus:** The plan and prompts must explicitly guide agents to produce high-quality, stable, production-ready application code directly. Enforce modern library usage (React, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand/RTK, React Router) and reusable components. Code must be clean, minimal, and professional.\n*   **Intelligent & Granular Decomposition:** The division of tasks among the 5 agents must be logical, creating self-contained units of work while ensuring a cohesive final application. Be very specific about which agent owns which files.\n*   **Clarity & Unambiguity:** The `plan.txt` and each agent's instructions must be crystal clear to prevent misinterpretation by the worker LLMs. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice, but be technically precise.\n*   **MANDATORY File Path Markers:** The instruction for agents to prefix their code output for each file with a comment like `// --- FILE: path/to/your/file.tsx ---` (on its own line) followed by the actual code, is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL for the downstream system to correctly assemble the final application files. This must be in each worker's system instruction.\n*   **Self-Contained & Complete Agent Outputs:** Each agent must produce complete, runnable (in context of the whole app) code for the files it's responsible for. They should not output partial code, placeholders (unless specified in the plan), or instructions for other agents.\n*   **Awareness of Environment:** You, the Orchestrator, must be aware that the final output is an aggregation of text files. Your plan and agent instructions should lead to a set of files that, when placed in their intended directory structure, form a working React/Vite/TypeScript project.\nEnsure your generated JSON is perfectly valid and all strings are properly escaped.\n",
