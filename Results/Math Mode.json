            "solutionAttempt": "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the integral of sec(x) by rigorously following the provided sub-strategy.\n\n**1. Transformation of the Integral**\n\nThe problem is to compute ∫ sec(x) dx. The sub-strategy requires transforming the integral into the form C * ∫ du / (u^2 + 1). This is achieved using the complex exponential substitution u = e^(ix).\n\nFirst, express sec(x) in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula, e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x).\ncos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) / 2\nsec(x) = 1 / cos(x) = 2 / (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))\n\nLet u = e^(ix). Then e^(-ix) = 1/e^(ix) = 1/u.\nSubstituting this into the expression for sec(x):\nsec(x) = 2 / (u + 1/u) = 2 / ((u^2 + 1)/u) = 2u / (u^2 + 1).\n\nNext, we find the differential dx in terms of du.\nu = e^(ix)\ndu/dx = d/dx(e^(ix)) = i * e^(ix) = i * u\ndu = i * u * dx\ndx = du / (i * u)\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for sec(x) and dx into the integral:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [2u / (u^2 + 1)] * [du / (i * u)]\n\nThe 'u' terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n∫ [2 / (i * (u^2 + 1))] du\n\nThe constant factor 2/i can be taken outside the integral. We simplify this constant:\n2/i = 2(-i) / (i * -i) = -2i / (-i^2) = -2i / 1 = -2i.\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n∫ sec(x) dx = -2i ∫ du / (u^2 + 1)\nThis matches the required form C * ∫ du / (u^2 + 1), with C = -2i.\n\n**2. Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nThe sub-strategy directs to factor the denominator u^2 + 1 in the complex domain and perform a partial fraction decomposition.\nThe roots of u^2 + 1 = 0 are u^2 = -1, which gives u = i and u = -i.\nTherefore, the factorization is:\nu^2 + 1 = (u - i)(u + i).\n\nWe set up the partial fraction identity for the integrand 1 / (u^2 + 1):\n1 / ((u - i)(u + i)) = A / (u - i) + B / (u + i)\n\nTo solve for the constants A and B, we multiply both sides by (u - i)(u + i):\n1 = A(u + i) + B(u - i)\n\nWe can solve for A and B by substituting the roots of the denominator.\nLet u = i:\n1 = A(i + i) + B(i - i)\n1 = A(2i) + B(0)\n1 = 2i * A\nA = 1 / (2i) = -i / (2 * -i * i) = -i / 2\n\nLet u = -i:\n1 = A(-i + i) + B(-i - i)\n1 = A(0) + B(-2i)\n1 = -2i * B\nB = 1 / (-2i) = i / (-2i * i) = i / 2\n\nSo the partial fraction decomposition is:\n1 / (u^2 + 1) = (-i/2) / (u - i) + (i/2) / (u + i)\n\n**3. Integration**\n\nNow, substitute the decomposition back into the transformed integral from Step 1:\n∫ sec(x) dx = -2i ∫ [ (-i/2) / (u - i) + (i/2) / (u + i) ] du\n\nDistribute the constant -2i into the integral:\n∫ [ (-2i)(-i/2) / (u - i) + (-2i)(i/2) / (u + i) ] du\n= ∫ [ (2i^2 / 2) / (u - i) + (-2i^2 / 2) / (u + i) ] du\n= ∫ [ i^2 / (u - i) - i^2 / (u + i) ] du\n\nSince i^2 = -1:\n= ∫ [ -1 / (u - i) + 1 / (u + i) ] du\n\nThis separates into two elementary integrals:\n= ∫ du / (u + i) - ∫ du / (u - i)\n\nThese are standard logarithmic integrals:\n= ln(u + i) - ln(u - i) + K\nwhere K is the constant of integration.\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b):\n= ln( (u + i) / (u - i) ) + K\n\n**4. Back-Substitution and Simplification**\n\nThe sub-strategy requires substituting u = e^(ix) back and manipulating the result into a real-valued form.\nResult = ln( (e^(ix) + i) / (e^(ix) - i) ) + K\n\nWe now manipulate the argument of the logarithm.\nArgument = (e^(ix) + i) / (e^(ix) - i)\nSubstitute Euler's formula, e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x):\nArgument = ( (cos(x) + i sin(x)) + i ) / ( (cos(x) + i sin(x)) - i )\n= ( cos(x) + i(sin(x) + 1) ) / ( cos(x) + i(sin(x) - 1) )\n\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is (cos(x) - i(sin(x) - 1)):\nNumerator = (cos(x) + i(sin(x) + 1)) * (cos(x) - i(sin(x) - 1))\n= cos^2(x) - i*cos(x)(sin(x)-1) + i*cos(x)(sin(x)+1) - i^2(sin(x)+1)(sin(x)-1)\n= cos^2(x) + i*cos(x)[-(sin(x)-1) + (sin(x)+1)] + (sin^2(x)-1)\n= cos^2(x) + i*cos(x)[-sin(x)+1+sin(x)+1] + (-cos^2(x))\n= cos^2(x) + i*cos(x)[2] - cos^2(x)\n= 2i cos(x)\n\nDenominator = (cos(x) + i(sin(x) - 1)) * (cos(x) - i(sin(x) - 1))\n= cos^2(x) + (sin(x) - 1)^2\n= cos^2(x) + (sin^2(x) - 2sin(x) + 1)\n= (cos^2(x) + sin^2(x)) - 2sin(x) + 1\n= 1 - 2sin(x) + 1\n= 2 - 2sin(x) = 2(1 - sin(x))\n\nSo, the argument of the logarithm simplifies to:\nArgument = (2i cos(x)) / (2(1 - sin(x))) = i * cos(x) / (1 - sin(x))\n\nWe can simplify this trigonometric expression further:\ncos(x) / (1 - sin(x)) = [cos(x) * (1 + sin(x))] / [(1 - sin(x)) * (1 + sin(x))]\n= [cos(x) + cos(x)sin(x)] / [1 - sin^2(x)]\n= [cos(x) + cos(x)sin(x)] / cos^2(x)\n= cos(x)/cos^2(x) + cos(x)sin(x)/cos^2(x)\n= 1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x)\n= sec(x) + tan(x)\n\nTherefore, the argument of the logarithm is i * (sec(x) + tan(x)).\nThe integral is:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ln( i * (sec(x) + tan(x)) ) + K\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n= ln(i) + ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) + K\n\nThe term ln(i) is a complex constant. The principal value is ln(i) = ln|i| + i*arg(i) = ln(1) + i(π/2) = i(π/2).\nThe indefinite integral is defined up to an arbitrary constant. The specific constant ln(i) can be absorbed into the arbitrary constant of integration K. Let C = K + ln(i). C is an arbitrary complex constant.\nThe family of antiderivatives is thus ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) + C.\n\nFor the integral of a real-valued function over real variables, the result is typically expressed as a real-valued function plus a real constant. To ensure the argument of the logarithm is positive and the function is defined over the largest possible domain, the absolute value is used.\nThis gives the final, real-valued form of the antiderivative.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe definitive result of the integration is:\nln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C"

This is achieved through the Euler substitution `u = e^(ix)`.\n\nFirst, express sec(x) in terms of `u`.\nUsing Euler's formula, `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x)`.\nThe cosine function is given by `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) / 2`.\nWith `u = e^(ix)`, we have `e^(-ix) = 1/u`.\nSubstituting `u` into the expression for `cos(x)`:\n`cos(x) = (u + 1/u) / 2 = (u^2 + 1) / (2u)`.\nTherefore, `sec(x) = 1/cos(x) = 2u / (u^2 + 1)`.\n\nNext, express the differential `dx` in terms of `du`.\nFrom `u = e^(ix)`, we differentiate with respect to `x`:\n`du/dx = i * e^(ix) = i * u`.\nRearranging for `dx`, we get `dx = du / (iu)`.\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the integral:\n∫sec(x) dx = ∫ [2u / (u^2 + 1)] * [du / (iu)]\n∫sec(x) dx = ∫ [2 / (i * (u^2 + 1))] du\n\nWe can simplify the constant `2/i`:\n`2/i = (2 * -i) / (i * -i) = -2i / (-i^2) = -2i / 1 = -2i`.\nSo the integral becomes:\n∫sec(x) dx = ∫ [-2i / (u^2 + 1)] du.\nThis is the rational function in `u` that the sub-strategy refers to. Let `f(u) = -2i / (u^2 + 1)`.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Poles and Partial Fraction Decomposition via Residues**\n\nThe sub-strategy requires identifying the simple poles of `f(u)` and interpreting the partial fraction decomposition as finding the residues at these poles.\n\nThe poles are the roots of the denominator `u^2 + 1 = 0`.\n`u^2 = -1`, which gives the simple poles `u = i` and `u = -i`.\n\nWe decompose `f(u)` into partial fractions:\n`f(u) = -2i / ((u - i)(u + i)) = A/(u - i) + B/(u + i)`.\n\nThe coefficient `A` is the residue of `f(u)` at the pole `u = i`:\n`A = Res(f, i) = lim (u→i) [(u - i) * f(u)]`\n`A = lim (u→i) [(u - i) * (-2i / ((u - i)(u + i)))]`\n`A = lim (u→i) [-2i / (u + i)] = -2i / (i + i) = -2i / (2i) = -1`.\n\nThe coefficient `B` is the residue of `f(u)` at the pole `u = -i`:\n`B = Res(f, -i) = lim (u→-i) [(u + i) * f(u)]`\n`B = lim (u→-i) [(u + i) * (-2i / ((u - i)(u + i)))]`\n`B = lim (u→-i) [-2i / (u - i)] = -2i / (-i - i) = -2i / (-2i) = 1`.\n\nThus, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n`f(u) = -1/(u - i) + 1/(u + i)`.\n\n**Step 3: Integration and Expression as a Complex Logarithm**\n\nWe now integrate the decomposed function:\n∫ f(u) du = ∫ [-1/(u - i) + 1/(u + i)] du\n= -∫ 1/(u - i) du + ∫ 1/(u + i) du\nUsing the standard integral ∫(1/z)dz = log(z), where log is the complex logarithm:\n= -log(u - i) + log(u + i) + C'\n= log(u + i) - log(u - i) + C'\nUsing the property `log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)`:\n= log( (u + i) / (u - i) ) + C'\n\nLet `Z = (u + i) / (u - i)`. The integral is `log(Z) + C'`.\n\n**Step 4: Geometric Interpretation of the Logarithm Argument `Z`**\n\nThe sub-strategy mandates a geometric analysis of `Z`. We represent `u = e^(ix)` as a point on the unit circle in the Argand (complex) plane. The poles are `p1 = i` and `p2 = -i`.\n\nThe complex number `Z` can be written as `Z = (u - (-i)) / (u - i)`.\nThe numerator, `u - (-i)`, is the vector from the pole `-i` to the point `u`.\nThe denominator, `u - i`, is the vector from the pole `i` to the point `u`.\n\nThe complex logarithm is `log(Z) = ln|Z| + i*arg(Z)`. We will determine the modulus `|Z|` and the argument `arg(Z)` geometrically.\n\n**4a. Geometric Determination of the Modulus `|Z|`**\n\nThe modulus `|Z|` is the ratio of the lengths (moduli) of the numerator and denominator vectors:\n`|Z| = |u + i| / |u - i|`.\n`|u + i|` is the Euclidean distance from the point representing `-i` (i.e., (0, -1)) to the point representing `u` (i.e., (cos x, sin x)).\n`|u + i|^2 = (cos x - 0)^2 + (sin x - (-1))^2 = cos^2(x) + (sin x + 1)^2`\n`= cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) + 2sin(x) + 1 = 1 + 2sin(x) + 1 = 2(1 + sin x)`.\n\n`|u - i|` is the Euclidean distance from the point `i` (i.e., (0, 1)) to the point `u`.\n`|u - i|^2 = (cos x - 0)^2 + (sin x - 1)^2 = cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) - 2sin(x) + 1`\n`= 1 - 2sin(x) + 1 = 2(1 - sin x)`.\n\nNow, we find the ratio of the squares of the moduli:\n`|Z|^2 = |u + i|^2 / |u - i|^2 = [2(1 + sin x)] / [2(1 - sin x)] = (1 + sin x) / (1 - sin x)`.\n\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by `(1 + sin x)`:\n`|Z|^2 = (1 + sin x)^2 / ((1 - sin x)(1 + sin x)) = (1 + sin x)^2 / (1 - sin^2 x)`.\nUsing the identity `1 - sin^2(x) = cos^2(x)`:\n`|Z|^2 = (1 + sin x)^2 / cos^2(x) = ((1 + sin x) / cos x)^2`.\n\nTaking the square root:\n`|Z| = |(1 + sin x) / cos x| = |1/cos x + sin x/cos x| = |sec x + tan x|`.\nTherefore, the real part of the integral is `ln|Z| = ln|sec x + tan x|`.\n\n**4b. Geometric Determination of the Argument `arg(Z)`**\n\nThe argument `arg(Z)` is the difference between the arguments of the numerator and denominator vectors:\n`arg(Z) = arg(u + i) - arg(u - i)`.\n\nThis represents the angle between the vector from `-i` to `u` and the vector from `i` to `u`.\nConsider the three points in the Argand plane: `P_u = u`, `P_i = i`, and `P_{-i} = -i`.\nThe point `u = e^(ix)` lies on the unit circle centered at the origin.\nThe points `i` and `-i` also lie on the unit circle and are endpoints of a vertical diameter.\nBy Thales' theorem, for any point `u` on a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter at that point is a right angle. Here, the diameter connects `i` and `-i`.\nTherefore, the angle `∠(i, u, -i)` is `π/2` radians (90 degrees).\n\nThis means the vectors `(u - i)` and `(u - (-i)) = (u + i)` are perpendicular.\nThe difference in their arguments must be `±π/2`.\n`arg(u + i) - arg(u - i) = ±π/2`.\n\nTo determine the sign, let's analyze the orientation of the vectors for `x` in the interval `(-π/2, π/2)`, where `cos(x) > 0`.\nThe point `u = (cos x, sin x)` is in the first or fourth quadrant.\nThe vector `v_1 = u + i` points from `-i` to `u`. It has a positive real component (`cos x`) and a positive vertical component (`sin x + 1`), so `arg(v_1)` is in `(-π/2, π/2)`.\nThe vector `v_2 = u - i` points from `i` to `u`. It has a positive real component (`cos x`) and a negative vertical component (`sin x - 1`), so `arg(v_2)` is in `(-π/2, 0)` for `sin(x)<1`.\nThe angle `arg(u+i)` is \"ahead\" of `arg(u-i)` in the counter-clockwise direction.\nTherefore, `arg(u + i) - arg(u - i) = +π/2`.\n\nSo, `arg(Z) = π/2`. This is a constant.\n\n**Step 5: Final Solution Assembly**\n\nWe combine the real and imaginary parts of the solution:\n∫sec(x) dx = log(Z) + C' = ln|Z| + i*arg(Z) + C'\nSubstituting the geometrically derived values:\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|sec x + tan x| + i(π/2) + C'\n\nThe term `i(π/2)` is a constant. It can be absorbed into the arbitrary constant of integration `C'`. Let `C = C' + i(π/2)`.\n\nThe integral is therefore:\n∫sec(x) dx = ln|sec x + tan x| + C.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sub-strategy, when followed with rigorous geometric and algebraic execution, successfully yields the definitive solution. Every step, from the initial substitution to the geometric interpretation of the complex logarithm's argument, has been meticulously executed. The process confirms the validity of the provided plan.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe definitive and unambiguous answer derived exclusively from the provided sub-strategy is:\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

            "solutionAttempt": "**Execution of Sub-Strategy 4**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the integral of `sec(x)` by simplifying a known complex antiderivative using polar form conversion.\n\n**Initial Derivation of the Complex Antiderivative**\n\nThe sub-strategy begins from a known complex antiderivative. For completeness, we first establish this form. The integral of `sec(x)` is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ (1/cos(x)) dx`\nUsing Euler's formula, `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2`. Let `u = e^(ix)`. This implies `e^(-ix) = 1/u` and `du = i * e^(ix) dx = i * u * dx`, so `dx = du / (iu)`.\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n`∫ (1 / ((u + 1/u)/2)) * (du / (iu)) = ∫ (2 / (u + 1/u)) * (du / (iu))`\n`= ∫ (2u / (u^2 + 1)) * (du / (iu)) = (2/i) ∫ (1 / (u^2 + 1)) du`\n\nWe integrate `1 / (u^2 + 1)` using partial fractions.\n`1 / (u^2 + 1) = 1 / ((u - i)(u + i)) = A/(u - i) + B/(u + i)`\nSolving for `A` and `B`:\n`1 = A(u + i) + B(u - i)`\nSetting `u = i`: `1 = A(2i) ⇒ A = 1/(2i)`\nSetting `u = -i`: `1 = B(-2i) ⇒ B = -1/(2i)`\nSo, `(1 / (u^2 + 1)) = (1/(2i)) * (1/(u - i) - 1/(u + i))`\n\nSubstituting this back into the integral expression:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = (2/i) ∫ (1/(2i)) * (1/(u - i) - 1/(u + i)) du`\n`= (2 / (2i^2)) ∫ (1/(u - i) - 1/(u + i)) du`\n`= (-1) * [log(u - i) - log(u + i)] + K`\n`= -log((u - i) / (u + i)) + K`\n\nThis establishes the starting point `-log((u - i)/(u + i)) + K` where `u = e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x)`, which aligns with the form `C * log((u - i)/(u + i))` mentioned in the sub-strategy, with `C = -1`.\n\n**Step 1: Express the terms in Cartesian form**\n\nFollowing the sub-strategy, we analyze the expression `log((u - i)/(u + i))`.\nLet `z1 = u - i` and `z2 = u + i`.\nSubstitute `u = cos(x) + i sin(x)`:\n`z1 = (cos(x) + i sin(x)) - i = cos(x) + i(sin(x) - 1)`\n`z2 = (cos(x) + i sin(x)) + i = cos(x) + i(sin(x) + 1)`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Modulus of `z1` and `z2`**\n\nWe calculate the modulus `|z| = sqrt(Re(z)^2 + Im(z)^2)` for `z1` and `z2`.\n\nFor `z1`:\n`|z1|^2 = cos^2(x) + (sin(x) - 1)^2`\n`= cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) - 2sin(x) + 1`\n`= (cos^2(x) + sin^2(x)) - 2sin(x) + 1 = 1 - 2sin(x) + 1 = 2(1 - sin(x))`\nUsing the half-angle identities `1 = cos^2(x/2) + sin^2(x/2)` and `sin(x) = 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2)`:\n`|z1|^2 = 2(cos^2(x/2) + sin^2(x/2) - 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2)) = 2(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))^2`\nSo, `|z1| = sqrt(2) * |cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)|`.\n\nFor `z2`:\n`|z2|^2 = cos^2(x) + (sin(x) + 1)^2`\n`= cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) + 2sin(x) + 1`\n`= (cos^2(x) + sin^2(x)) + 2sin(x) + 1 = 1 + 2sin(x) + 1 = 2(1 + sin(x))`\nUsing half-angle identities:\n`|z2|^2 = 2(cos^2(x/2) + sin^2(x/2) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2)) = 2(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))^2`\nSo, `|z2| = sqrt(2) * |cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)|`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Argument of `z1` and `z2`**\n\nWe calculate the principal argument `Arg(z)`. To avoid ambiguity, we analyze the principal domain of `sec(x)`, which is `x ∈ (-π/2, π/2)`. In this interval, `cos(x) > 0`.\n\nFor `z1 = cos(x) + i(sin(x) - 1)`:\nThe real part `cos(x)` is positive. The imaginary part `sin(x) - 1` is negative (since `sin(x) < 1` for this domain). Thus, `z1` is in the fourth quadrant.\n`Arg(z1) = arctan((sin(x) - 1) / cos(x))`\nUsing half-angle identities for the argument of the arctan function:\nNumerator: `sin(x) - 1 = 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) - (sin^2(x/2) + cos^2(x/2)) = -(cos^2(x/2) - 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + sin^2(x/2)) = -(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))^2`\nDenominator: `cos(x) = cos^2(x/2) - sin^2(x/2) = (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`\nRatio: `-(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`\nDivide numerator and denominator by `cos(x/2)` (which is non-zero for `x ∈ (-π/2, π/2)`):\nRatio = `-(1 - tan(x/2)) / (1 + tan(x/2)) = -tan(π/4 - x/2) = tan(x/2 - π/4)`\n`Arg(z1) = arctan(tan(x/2 - π/4)) = x/2 - π/4`. This is valid as for `x ∈ (-π/2, π/2)`, `x/2 - π/4 ∈ (-π/2, 0)`, which is in the correct range for `arctan` in the fourth quadrant.\n\nFor `z2 = cos(x) + i(sin(x) + 1)`:\nThe real part `cos(x)` is positive. The imaginary part `sin(x) + 1` is also positive. Thus, `z2` is in the first quadrant.\n`Arg(z2) = arctan((sin(x) + 1) / cos(x))`\nNumerator: `sin(x) + 1 = (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))^2`\nDenominator: `cos(x) = (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`\nRatio: `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)) = (1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) = tan(π/4 + x/2)`\n`Arg(z2) = arctan(tan(π/4 + x/2)) = π/4 + x/2`. This is valid as for `x ∈ (-π/2, π/2)`, `π/4 + x/2 ∈ (0, π/2)`.\n\n**Step 4: Reconstruct the Logarithm**\n\nThe antiderivative is `I = -log(z1/z2) + K`. Using the property `log(w) = log|w| + i*arg(w)`:\n`I = - [ log|z1/z2| + i * arg(z1/z2) ] + K`\n`I = - [ log(|z1|/|z2|) + i * (arg(z1) - arg(z2)) ] + K`\n`I = -log(|z1|/|z2|) - i(Arg(z1) - Arg(z2)) + K'` (where `K'` absorbs any `2nπi` terms from the general logarithm).\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the Real Part**\n\nThe real part of the integral is `-log(|z1|/|z2|)`.\n`|z1|/|z2| = (sqrt(2) * |cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)|) / (sqrt(2) * |cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)|)`\nFor `x ∈ (-π/2, π/2)`, `x/2 ∈ (-π/4, π/4)`. In this interval, `cos(x/2) > |sin(x/2)|`, so both `(cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))` and `(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))` are positive. We can drop the absolute value signs.\n`|z1|/|z2| = (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))`\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`|z1|/|z2| = sqrt( (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))^2 / (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))^2 ) = sqrt( (1 - sin(x)) / (1 + sin(x)) )`\n`= sqrt( (1 - sin(x))^2 / ((1 + sin(x))(1 - sin(x))) ) = sqrt( (1 - sin(x))^2 / (1 - sin^2(x)) )`\n`= sqrt( (1 - sin(x))^2 / cos^2(x) ) = |(1 - sin(x)) / cos(x)| = |sec(x) - tan(x)|`\nFor `x ∈ (-π/2, π/2)`, `sec(x) - tan(x) > 0`, so `|z1|/|z2| = sec(x) - tan(x)`.\nThe real part is `-log(sec(x) - tan(x))`.\nUsing the property `sec^2(x) - tan^2(x) = 1`, we have `(sec(x) - tan(x))(sec(x) + tan(x)) = 1`, which means `sec(x) - tan(x) = 1 / (sec(x) + tan(x))`.\nReal Part = `-log(1 / (sec(x) + tan(x))) = -(-1)log(sec(x) + tan(x)) = log(sec(x) + tan(x))`.\nTo generalize for all domains where sec(x) is defined, we use the absolute value: `log|sec(x) + tan(x)|`.\n\n**Step 6: Simplify the Imaginary Part**\n\nThe imaginary part of the integral is `-i(Arg(z1) - Arg(z2))`.\nUsing the results from Step 3:\n`Arg(z1) - Arg(z2) = (x/2 - π/4) - (x/2 + π/4) = -π/2`\nSo, the imaginary part is `-i(-π/2) = i(π/2)`.\nThis is a constant value.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the real and imaginary parts, the integral is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = log|sec(x) + tan(x)| + i(π/2) + K'`\nThe integrand `sec(x)` is a real-valued function. The indefinite integral represents a family of antiderivatives. Typically, one seeks the family of real-valued antiderivatives. The imaginary constant `i(π/2)` can be absorbed into the arbitrary complex constant of integration `K'`. If we require a real-valued antiderivative, we can define a new real constant `C = Re(K' + i(π/2))`.\nThe procedure demonstrates that the imaginary component resulting from the complex logarithm is a constant, which validates taking the real part as the functional part of the antiderivative.\n\nThe final, definitive answer for the indefinite integral of `sec(x)` is:\n\n`log|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

Define a new complex variable, t, based on a geometric transformation in the complex plane, specifically t = i * tan(x/2). Derive the expressions for e^(ix), cos(x), and the differential dx purely in terms of t and dt by manipulating the definition of t and its relation to e^(ix) via Mobius transformations. Substitute these expressions into the integral ∫ sec(x) dx. This will convert the trigonometric integral into an integral of a simple rational function of t. Evaluate this new integral with respect to t, and then substitute the original expression t = i * tan(x/2) back into the result. The final step involves simplifying the resulting complex expression into its final real-valued form.; Strategy 3: Pivot the problem from the domain of circular trigonometric functions to hyperbolic functions using complex arguments. Start by applying the identity sec(x) = sech(ix), which connects the two types of functions. The problem is now to evaluate ∫ sech(ix) dx. Introduce a substitution z = ix, which implies dx = -i dz. This transforms the integral into a constant multiple of the standard integral of sech(z). Find the antiderivative of sech(z), which is a known result involving inverse hyperbolic or inverse trigonometric functions (e.g., arctan(sinh(z))). Substitute z = ix back into this antiderivative. The resulting expression will involve functions of complex arguments, such as arctan(sinh(ix)).

Propose a candidate solution of the form F(z) = log(H(z)), where H(z) is a function constructed from complex trigonometric functions, specifically H(z) = sec(z) + tan(z). The strategy is to prove that F'(z) = sec(z). Using the rules of complex differentiation, calculate the derivative of F(z), which is H'(z)/H(z). Compute the derivative H'(z) = d/dz [sec(z) + tan(z)]. Show through algebraic manipulation that H'(z) is equal to sec(z) * H(z). This will demonstrate that the logarithmic derivative H'(z)/H(z) simplifies exactly to sec(z). By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this proves that the integral of sec(z) is log(H(z)), and the solution for the real integral is found by evaluating this function for real x.\n\nYour task: Devise 4 **ENTIRELY NOVEL, UNIQUE, INDEPENDENT, and SELF-CONTAINED mini-plans (sub-strategies)**.

The final step involves simplifying the resulting complex expression into its final real-valued form.; Strategy 3: Pivot the problem from the domain of circular trigonometric functions to hyperbolic functions using complex arguments. Start by applying the identity sec(x) = sech(ix), which connects the two types of functions. The problem is now to evaluate ∫ sech(ix) dx. Introduce a substitution z = ix, which implies dx = -i dz. This transforms the integral into a constant multiple of the standard integral of sech(z). Find the antiderivative of sech(z), which is a known result involving inverse hyperbolic or inverse trigonometric functions (e.g., arctan(sinh(z))). Substitute z = ix back into this antiderivative. The resulting expression will involve functions of complex arguments, such as arctan(sinh(ix)). Use complex identities, like sinh(ix) = i sin(x) and the logarithmic form of the complex inverse tangent function, to convert the expression back into a real-valued function of x.; Strategy 4: Employ a verification approach using the logarithmic derivative in the complex plane. Propose a candidate solution of the form F(z) = log(H(z)), where H(z) is a function constructed from complex trigonometric functions, specifically H(z) = sec(z) + tan(z). The strategy is to prove that F'(z) = sec(z). Using the rules of complex differentiation, calculate the derivative of F(z), which is H'(z)/H(z). Compute the derivative H'(z) = d/dz [sec(z) + tan(z)]. Show through algebraic manipulation that H'(z) is equal to sec(z) * H(z). This will demonstrate that the logarithmic derivative H'(z)/H(z) simplifies exactly to sec(z). By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this proves that the integral of sec(z) is log(H(z)), and the solution for the real integral is found by evaluating this function for real x.\".

Start with the substitution `t = i * tan(x/2)`.\n2.  Express `t` as a Mobius transformation of `u = e^(ix)`.\n3.  Invert this transformation to solve for `u` in terms of `t`.\n4.  From the expression for `u`, derive `cos(x)` and `dx` in terms of `t`.\n5.  Substitute these expressions into the integral.\n6.  Integrate the resulting rational function in `t`.\n7.  Back-substitute for `t` and simplify to obtain the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Express `t` as a Mobius Transformation of `u = e^(ix)`**\n\nThe substitution is given as `t = i * tan(x/2)`.\nLet `u = e^(ix)`. We express `tan(x/2)` in terms of `u`.\nUsing Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`, we have:\n`cos(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)) / 2`\n`sin(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / 2i`\n\nTherefore, `tan(x/2) = sin(x/2) / cos(x/2) = (e^(ix/2) - e^(-ix/2)) / (i * (e^(ix/2) + e^(-ix/2)))`.\nSince `u = e^(ix)`, we have `u^(1/2) = e^(ix/2)` and `u^(-1/2) = e^(-ix/2)`.\nSubstituting these into the expression for `tan(x/2)`:\n`tan(x/2) = (u^(1/2) - u^(-1/2)) / (i * (u^(1/2) + u^(-1/2)))`\nTo eliminate fractional powers, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `u^(1/2)`:\n`tan(x/2) = (u^(1/2) * (u^(1/2) - u^(-1/2))) / (u^(1/2) * i * (u^(1/2) + u^(-1/2))) = (u - 1) / (i * (u + 1))`\nNow, we substitute this into the definition of `t`:\n`t = i * tan(x/2) = i * [ (u - 1) / (i * (u + 1)) ]`\nThe `i` terms cancel, yielding the Mobius transformation:\n`t = (u - 1) / (u + 1)`\n\n**Step 2: Invert the Transformation to Solve for `u`**\n\nWe now solve the equation `t = (u - 1) / (u + 1)` for `u`.\n`t * (u + 1) = u - 1`\n`tu + t = u - 1`\n`t + 1 = u - tu`\n`t + 1 = u(1 - t)`\n`u = (1 + t) / (1 - t)`\nSince `u = e^(ix)`, we have `e^(ix) = (1 + t) / (1 - t)`.\n\n**Step 3: Derive Expressions for `cos(x)` and `dx`**\n\n*   **Deriving `cos(x)`:**\n    The definition of `cos(x)` in terms of complex exponentials is `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) / 2`.\n    We have `e^(ix) = u = (1 + t) / (1 - t)`.\n    Then, `e^(-ix) = 1/u = 1 / [(1 + t) / (1 - t)] = (1 - t) / (1 + t)`.\n    Substituting these into the formula for `cos(x)`:\n    `cos(x) = (1/2) * [ ((1 + t) / (1 - t)) + ((1 - t) / (1 + t)) ]`\n    We find a common denominator, which is `(1 - t)(1 + t) = 1 - t^2`.\n    `cos(x) = (1/2) * [ ((1 + t)^2 + (1 - t)^2) / (1 - t^2) ]`\n    Expand the squares in the numerator:\n    `(1 + t)^2 = 1 + 2t + t^2`\n    `(1 - t)^2 = 1 - 2t + t^2`\n    The sum is `(1 + 2t + t^2) + (1 - 2t + t^2) = 2 + 2t^2 = 2(1 + t^2)`.\n    `cos(x) = (1/2) * [ 2(1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2) ] = (1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)`\n    The integrand is `sec(x) = 1/cos(x)`, so:\n    `sec(x) = (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2)`\n\n*   **Deriving `dx`:**\n    We start from `e^(ix) = (1 + t) / (1 - t)`. We differentiate both sides with respect to `t`.\n    Left side (using the chain rule): `d/dt(e^(ix)) = e^(ix) * (i * dx/dt)`.\n    Right side (using the quotient rule): `d/dt((1 + t) / (1 - t)) = [ (1)(1 - t) - (1 + t)(-1) ] / (1 - t)^2 = [ 1 - t + 1 + t ] / (1 - t)^2 = 2 / (1 - t)^2`.\n    Equating the two derivatives:\n    `e^(ix) * i * (dx/dt) = 2 / (1 - t)^2`\n    Substitute `e^(ix) = (1 + t) / (1 - t)`:\n    `[ (1 + t) / (1 - t) ] * i * (dx/dt) = 2 / (1 - t)^2`\n    Now, solve for `dx/dt`:\n    `dx/dt = (1/i) * [ (1 - t) / (1 + t) ] * [ 2 / (1 - t)^2 ] = (1/i) * [ 2 / ((1 + t)(1 - t)) ]`\n    `dx/dt = 2 / (i * (1 - t^2))`\n    Therefore, the differential `dx` is:\n    `dx = [ 2 / (i * (1 - t^2)) ] dt`\n\n**Step 4: Substitute into the Integral and Integrate**\n\nWe substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` into the integral `∫ sec(x) dx`.\n`∫ [ (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2) ] * [ 2 / (i * (1 - t^2)) ] dt`\nThe term `(1 - t^2)` cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n`∫ (1 / (1 + t^2)) * (2/i) dt`\nWe factor out the constant `2/i`:\n`(2/i) ∫ 1 / (1 + t^2) dt`\nThe integral of `1 / (1 + t^2)` is `arctan(t)`. So, the result is:\n`(2/i) * arctan(t) + C'`\nSince `1/i = -i`, we can write `2/i` as `-2i`.\nIntegral = `-2i * arctan(t) + C'`\n\n**Step 5: Back-substitute and Simplify**\n\nWe substitute `t = i * tan(x/2)` back into the result.\nResult = `-2i * arctan(i * tan(x/2)) + C'`\nTo simplify this expression, we use the logarithmic form of the inverse tangent function: `arctan(z) = (1/2i) * ln((1 + iz) / (1 - iz))`.\nLet `z = i * tan(x/2)`. Then `iz = i * (i * tan(x/2)) = i^2 * tan(x/2) = -tan(x/2)`.\nSubstituting this into the logarithmic formula for `arctan`:\n`arctan(i * tan(x/2)) = (1/2i) * ln( (1 + (-tan(x/2))) / (1 - (-tan(x/2))) )`\n`arctan(i * tan(x/2)) = (1/2i) * ln( (1 - tan(x/2)) / (1 + tan(x/2)) )`\nNow substitute this back into our integrated expression:\nResult = `-2i * [ (1/2i) * ln( (1 - tan(x/2)) / (1 + tan(x/2)) ) ] + C'`\nThe `-2i` and `1/2i` terms cancel each other out to `-1`.\nResult = `-1 * ln( (1 - tan(x/2)) / (1 + tan(x/2)) ) + C'`\nUsing the logarithm property `-ln(a) = ln(1/a)`:\nResult = `ln( [ (1 - tan(x/2)) / (1 + tan(x/2)) ]^(-1) ) + C'`\nResult = `ln( (1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) ) + C'`\n\nTo complete the simplification, we show that this expression is equivalent to the standard form. We rewrite `tan(x/2)` as `sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)`:\n`(1 + sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) / (1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)) = (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))`\nNow, consider `sec(x) + tan(x)`:\n`sec(x) + tan(x) = 1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) = (1 + sin(x)) / cos(x)`\nUsing the half-angle identities `1 = cos^2(x/2) + sin^2(x/2)`, `sin(x) = 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2)`, and `cos(x) = cos^2(x/2) - sin^2(x/2)`:\n`sec(x) + tan(x) = (cos^2(x/2) + sin^2(x/2) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2)) / (cos^2(x/2) - sin^2(x/2))`\n`= (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2))^2 / ((cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))(cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)))`\n`= (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2))`\nThis confirms the identity. Thus, the integral is `ln(sec(x) + tan(x)) + C'`.\n\nFor the antiderivative to be a real-valued function defined wherever the original function `sec(x)` is defined, the argument of the natural logarithm must be positive. The expression `sec(x) + tan(x)` can be negative. Therefore, the final, fully simplified, and unambiguous answer for the indefinite integral over the real numbers requires the use of an absolute value.\n\nFinal Result = `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`"

Begin by directly differentiating the substitution t = i * tan(x/2) with respect to x to find dt/dx. This will give dt/dx = (i/2)sec^2(x/2). Rearrange to get an expression for dx in terms of dt and sec^2(x/2). Now, use the identity 1 + tan^2(A) = sec^2(A) to express sec^2(x/2) in terms of tan^2(x/2). Since t = i*tan(x/2), it follows that tan(x/2) = -it, so tan^2(x/2) = -t^2. Use this to get sec^2(x/2) and thus dx entirely in terms of t and dt. For cos(x), use the half-angle identity cos(x) = (1 - tan^2(x/2)) / (1 + tan^2(x/2)) and substitute tan^2(x/2) = -t^2. Substitute both the derived cos(x) and dx into the integral, solve, and back-substitute.\n\n**Step 1: Differentiate the substitution `t = i * tan(x/2)`**\n\nThe given substitution is `t = i * tan(x/2)`. We differentiate `t` with respect to `x` using the chain rule.\nLet `u = x/2`, so `du/dx = 1/2`.\n`t = i * tan(u)`\n`dt/dx = d/dx [i * tan(u)]`\n`dt/dx = i * d/du[tan(u)] * du/dx`\nThe derivative of `tan(u)` is `sec^2(u)`.\n`dt/dx = i * sec^2(u) * (1/2)`\nSubstituting `u = x/2` back:\n`dt/dx = (i/2) * sec^2(x/2)`\n\n**Step 2: Express `dx` in terms of `dt` and `t`**\n\nFrom the result of Step 1, we rearrange the equation to solve for `dx`.\n`dt = (i/2) * sec^2(x/2) dx`\n`dx = dt / [(i/2) * sec^2(x/2)]`\n`dx = (2/i) * (1 / sec^2(x/2)) dt`\n\nNext, we express `sec^2(x/2)` in terms of `t`. The sub-strategy instructs to use the Pythagorean identity `1 + tan^2(A) = sec^2(A)`. Let `A = x/2`:\n`sec^2(x/2) = 1 + tan^2(x/2)`\n\nFrom the initial substitution `t = i * tan(x/2)`, we solve for `tan(x/2)`:\n`tan(x/2) = t / i`\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by `-i`:\n`tan(x/2) = (t * -i) / (i * -i) = -it / (-i^2) = -it / (1) = -it`\n\nNow, we find `tan^2(x/2)`:\n`tan^2(x/2) = (-it)^2 = (-i)^2 * t^2 = i^2 * t^2 = -1 * t^2 = -t^2`\n\nSubstitute this into the identity for `sec^2(x/2)`:\n`sec^2(x/2) = 1 + (-t^2) = 1 - t^2`\n\nFinally, substitute this expression for `sec^2(x/2)` back into our equation for `dx`:\n`dx = (2/i) * (1 / (1 - t^2)) dt`\n\n**Step 3: Express `sec(x)` in terms of `t`**\n\nThe integral is `∫ sec(x) dx`, which is `∫ (1/cos(x)) dx`. We need to express `cos(x)` in terms of `t`. The sub-strategy specifies using the tangent half-angle identity:\n`cos(x) = (1 - tan^2(x/2)) / (1 + tan^2(x/2))`\n\nUsing our previously derived result `tan^2(x/2) = -t^2`:\n`cos(x) = (1 - (-t^2)) / (1 + (-t^2)) = (1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)`\n\nTherefore, `sec(x) = 1/cos(x)` is:\n`sec(x) = 1 / [(1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)] = (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2)`\n\n**Step 4: Substitute into the integral and solve**\n\nWe now substitute the expressions for `sec(x)` and `dx` in terms of `t` into the original integral:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2) ] * [ (2/i) * (1 / (1 - t^2)) dt ]`\n\nThe term `(1 - t^2)` in the numerator of the first expression cancels with the `(1 - t^2)` in the denominator of the second expression, provided `1 - t^2 ≠ 0`.\n`∫ [ 1 / (1 + t^2) ] * (2/i) dt`\n\nWe pull the constant `(2/i)` out of the integral:\n`I = (2/i) ∫ 1 / (1 + t^2) dt`\n\nThe integral `∫ 1 / (1 + t^2) dt` is a standard form, whose result is `arctan(t)`.\n`I = (2/i) * arctan(t) + C`\n\nTo simplify the constant `2/i`:\n`2/i = (2 * -i) / (i * -i) = -2i / (-i^2) = -2i / 1 = -2i`\nSo, the integral is:\n`I = -2i * arctan(t) + C`\n\n**Step 5: Back-substitute and simplify**\n\nThe final step is to substitute `t = i * tan(x/2)` back into the expression.\n`I = -2i * arctan(i * tan(x/2)) + C`\n\nTo simplify this expression involving the arctangent of a complex argument, we use the standard identity relating the inverse tangent to the complex natural logarithm: `arctan(z) = (i/2) * ln((i+z)/(i-z))`. A more direct form for a purely imaginary argument `iy` is `arctan(iy) = (-i/2) * ln((1-y)/(1+y))`.\nLet `y = tan(x/2)`. We apply this identity:\n`arctan(i * tan(x/2)) = (-i/2) * ln( (1 - tan(x/2)) / (1 + tan(x/2)) )`\n\nSubstitute this back into our expression for `I`:\n`I = -2i * [ (-i/2) * ln( (1 - tan(x/2)) / (1 + tan(x/2)) ) ] + C`\n\nMultiply the constant factors:\n`(-2i) * (-i/2) = (-2 * -1 * i^2) / 2 = i^2 = -1`\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n`I = -1 * ln( (1 - tan(x/2)) / (1 + tan(x/2)) ) + C`\n`I = -ln( (1 - tan(x/2)) / (1 + tan(x/2)) ) + C`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `-ln(a/b) = ln((a/b)^-1) = ln(b/a)`:\n`I = ln( (1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) ) + C`\n\nThis expression is the fully simplified result obtained by rigorously following the provided sub-strategy. This result is equivalent to the more common form `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe definitive answer, derived exclusively by executing the given sub-strategy, is:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ln( (1 + tan(x/2)) / (1 - tan(x/2)) ) + C`"

Since `y = tan(x/2)`, we can establish a relationship between `y` and `t`:\n`y = tan(x/2) = t / i`\n\nTo simplify this relationship, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `-i`:\n`y = t / i = (t * -i) / (i * -i) = -it / -i^2 = -it / -(-1) = -it / 1`\nSo, `y = -it`.\n\nNext, we find the differential `dy` in terms of `dt` by differentiating `y = -it` with respect to `t`:\n`dy/dt = -i`\n`dy = -i dt`\n\n**Step 2: Derive complex-variable equivalents for cos(x) and dx**\n\nUsing the relationships `y = -it` and `dy = -i dt`, we transform the real-variable formulas into complex-variable equivalents in terms of `t`.\n\nFor `cos(x)`:\n`cos(x) = (1 - y^2) / (1 + y^2)`\nSubstitute `y = -it`:\n`cos(x) = (1 - (-it)^2) / (1 + (-it)^2)`\nSimplify the term `(-it)^2`: `(-it)^2 = (-i)^2 * t^2 = -1 * t^2 = -t^2`.\n`cos(x) = (1 - (-t^2)) / (1 + (-t^2)) = (1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)`\n\nFor `dx`:\n`dx = 2dy / (1 + y^2)`\nSubstitute `dy = -i dt` and `y = -it`:\n`dx = 2(-i dt) / (1 + (-it)^2)`\nUsing `(-it)^2 = -t^2` from the previous step:\n`dx = -2i dt / (1 - t^2)`\n\n**Step 3: Transform and integrate the integral**\n\nThe original integral is `∫ sec(x) dx`, which is equivalent to `∫ (1/cos(x)) dx`. We substitute the derived expressions for `cos(x)` and `dx`.\n\nFirst, find the expression for `1/cos(x)`:\n`1/cos(x) = 1 / ((1 + t^2) / (1 - t^2)) = (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2)`\n\nNow, substitute `1/cos(x)` and `dx` into the integral:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ [ (1 - t^2) / (1 + t^2) ] * [ -2i dt / (1 - t^2) ]`\n\nThe term `(1 - t^2)` appears in the numerator and the denominator, allowing for cancellation. This is valid as `1 - t^2 ≠ 0` is equivalent to `cos(x) ≠ 0`, which is required for `sec(x)` to be defined.\n`∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ -2i / (1 + t^2) dt`\n\nWe can move the constant `-2i` outside the integral:\n`∫ sec(x) dx = -2i ∫ 1 / (1 + t^2) dt`\n\nThe integral of `1 / (1 + t^2)` with respect to `t` is a standard result, `arctan(t)`.\n`∫ sec(x) dx = -2i * arctan(t) + C`\n\n**Step 4: Substitute back and simplify the final expression**\n\nThe next step is to substitute `t = i * tan(x/2)` back into the result.\n`∫ sec(x) dx = -2i * arctan(i * tan(x/2)) + C`\n\nTo simplify this complex expression, we use the logarithmic representation of the inverse tangent function, `arctan(w) = (1/2i) * ln((1 + iw) / (1 - iw))`.

The argument of the natural logarithm must be positive. However, the expression `sec(x) + tan(x)` can be negative for certain values of `x` where `sec(x)` is defined (e.g., in the interval (π/2, 3π/2)). The correct antiderivative that is valid for all `x` where `sec(x)` is defined is `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|`.

            "solutionAttempt": "**Objective:** To calculate the integral `I = ∫ sec(x) dx` by rigorously following the provided sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 1: Transformation of the integral via substitution**\n\nThe sub-strategy begins with the substitution `z = ix`.\nFrom this substitution, we solve for the original variable `x`:\n`x = z / i`\nSince `1/i = -i`, this gives:\n`x = -iz`\n\nNext, we find the differential `dx` in terms of `dz` by differentiating `x` with respect to `z`:\n`dx/dz = d/dz (-iz) = -i`\nTherefore, `dx = -i dz`.\n\nNow, we substitute `x = -iz` into the integrand `sec(x)`:\n`sec(x) = sec(-iz)`\n\nTo simplify this, we use the fundamental relationship between the circular and hyperbolic cosine functions, `cos(w) = cosh(iw)`. The secant function is the reciprocal of the cosine function.\n`sec(-iz) = 1 / cos(-iz)`\nApplying the identity with `w = -iz`, we find `iw = i(-iz) = -i²z = -(-1)z = z`.\nThus, `cos(-iz) = cosh(z)`.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n`sec(-iz) = 1 / cosh(z) = sech(z)`\n\nFinally, we substitute `sec(x) = sech(z)` and `dx = -i dz` into the original integral:\n`I = ∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ sech(z) (-i dz)`\nFactoring out the constant `-i`, we arrive at the transformed integral as specified by the sub-strategy:\n`I = -i ∫ sech(z) dz`\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the antiderivative of sech(z)**\n\nThe sub-strategy specifies using the Gudermannian function, `gd(z)`, as the antiderivative of `sech(z)`. The Gudermannian function is defined such that its derivative with respect to its argument is the hyperbolic secant function:\n`d/dz(gd(z)) = sech(z)`\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of `sech(z)` is:\n`∫ sech(z) dz = gd(z) + C₁`\nwhere `C₁` is an arbitrary constant of integration.\n\n**Step 3: Statement of the integration result in terms of z**\n\nUsing the results from the previous steps, we express the integral `I` in terms of `z`.\nFrom Step 1: `I = -i ∫ sech(z) dz`\nFrom Step 2: `∫ sech(z) dz = gd(z) + C₁`\nSubstituting the second result into the first:\n`I = -i (gd(z) + C₁)`\n`I = -i * gd(z) - i * C₁`\nWe define a new arbitrary constant `C = -i * C₁`. The expression for the integral becomes:\n`I = -i * gd(z) + C`\n\n**Step 4: Substitution back to the original variable x**\n\nTo express the result in terms of the original variable `x`, we reverse the initial substitution `z = ix`.\nSubstituting `z = ix` into the expression for `I`:\n`I = -i * gd(ix) + C`\n\n**Step 5: Application of the specified complex identity**\n\nThe sub-strategy mandates the application of the specific identity `gd(ix) = i * arctan(x)`. We substitute this identity into our expression for `I`.\n`I = -i * (i * arctan(x)) + C`\n\n**Step 6: Resolution and simplification of the final expression**\n\nThe final step is to simplify the resulting expression to obtain the final answer. We multiply the complex coefficients:\n`I = (-i * i) * arctan(x) + C`\nBy definition, `i² = -1`. Therefore, the coefficient becomes:\n`-i * i = -i² = -(-1) = 1`\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for `I`:\n`I = 1 * arctan(x) + C`\n`I = arctan(x) + C`\n\nFollowing the provided sub-strategy with complete and rigorous adherence to each step leads to this definitive result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n`∫ sec(x) dx = arctan(x) + C`"

Start with the expression `-i ∫ sech(z) dz`.\n2.  Evaluate `∫ sech(z) dz` using the standard antiderivative `2 * arctan(e^z)`.\n3.  Substitute `z = ix` back into the resulting expression.\n4.  Expand `e^(ix)` using Euler's formula: `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i * sin(x)`.\n5.  Apply the logarithmic formula for complex inverse tangent: `arctan(w) = (1/2i) * log((1+iw)/(1-iw))`.\n6.  Simplify the resulting expression to a real-valued function.\n\n**Step-by-Step Execution:**\n\n**Step 1: Initial Conversion**\n\nThe sub-strategy begins with the expression `-i ∫ sech(z) dz`. To relate this to the original problem, `∫ sec(x) dx`, a variable substitution is required. Let us define the substitution `x = -iz`.\nFrom this substitution, we derive `z = ix` and `dx = -i dz`.\nThe integrand `sec(x)` becomes `sec(-iz)`.\nUsing the identity `sec(u) = sec(-u)`, we have `sec(-iz) = sec(iz)`.\nUsing the relationship between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, `cos(iz) = cosh(z)`, we find `sec(iz) = 1/cos(iz) = 1/cosh(z) = sech(z)`.\nSubstituting these into the original integral:\n∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ sech(z) (-i dz) = -i ∫ sech(z) dz.\nThis confirms that the substitution `z = ix` is consistent with the starting point provided by the sub-strategy.\n\n**Step 2: Application of the Given Antiderivative**\n\nThe sub-strategy instructs to use `∫ sech(z) dz = 2 * arctan(e^z)`. Applying this to our expression:\n-i ∫ sech(z) dz = -i * [2 * arctan(e^z) + C₀]\n= -2i * arctan(e^z) + C\nwhere C = -iC₀ is an arbitrary complex constant of integration.\n\n**Step 3: Substitution Back to x**\n\nWe now substitute `z = ix` back into the expression:\n-2i * arctan(e^z) + C = -2i * arctan(e^(ix)) + C.\n\n**Step 4: Expansion using Euler's Formula**\n\nThe term `e^(ix)` is expanded using Euler's formula: `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i * sin(x)`.\nThe expression becomes:\n-2i * arctan(cos(x) + i * sin(x)) + C.\n\n**Step 5: Application of the Logarithmic Formula for Complex Arctangent**\n\nThe sub-strategy requires using the formula `arctan(w) = (1/2i) * log((1+iw)/(1-iw))`, where `log` denotes the complex logarithm.\nLet `w = cos(x) + i * sin(x)`.\nSubstituting this into our expression from Step 4:\n∫ sec(x) dx = -2i * [ (1/(2i)) * log((1 + i*w) / (1 - i*w)) ] + C\n= -log((1 + i*w) / (1 - i*w)) + C.\n\n**Step 6: Simplification of the Logarithm's Argument**\n\nWe must now simplify the argument of the logarithm, `(1 + i*w) / (1 - i*w)`, where `w = cos(x) + i * sin(x)`.\n\nNumerator:\n1 + i*w = 1 + i(cos(x) + i * sin(x)) = 1 + i*cos(x) + i²*sin(x) = (1 - sin(x)) + i*cos(x).\n\nDenominator:\n1 - i*w = 1 - i(cos(x) + i * sin(x)) = 1 - i*cos(x) - i²*sin(x) = (1 + sin(x)) - i*cos(x).\n\nThe argument is `((1 - sin(x)) + i*cos(x)) / ((1 + sin(x)) - i*cos(x))`.\nTo simplify this fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is `(1 + sin(x)) + i*cos(x)`:\n\nDenominator simplification:\n((1 + sin(x)) - i*cos(x)) * ((1 + sin(x)) + i*cos(x))\n= (1 + sin(x))² - (i*cos(x))²\n= (1 + 2sin(x) + sin²(x)) - (-1 * cos²(x))\n= 1 + 2sin(x) + sin²(x) + cos²(x)\n= 1 + 2sin(x) + 1\n= 2(1 + sin(x)).\n\nNumerator simplification:\n((1 - sin(x)) + i*cos(x)) * ((1 + sin(x)) + i*cos(x))\n= (1 - sin(x))(1 + sin(x)) + i*cos(x)(1 - sin(x)) + i*cos(x)(1 + sin(x)) + (i*cos(x))²\n= (1 - sin²(x)) + i*cos(x) - i*sin(x)cos(x) + i*cos(x) + i*sin(x)cos(x) - cos²(x)\n= cos²(x) + 2i*cos(x) - cos²(x)\n= 2i*cos(x).\n\nThe simplified argument of the logarithm is:\n(2i*cos(x)) / (2(1 + sin(x))) = i * (cos(x) / (1 + sin(x))).\n\nThe integral is now expressed as:\n∫ sec(x) dx = -log( i * cos(x) / (1 + sin(x)) ) + C.\n\n**Step 7: Final Simplification and Analysis**\n\nTo simplify further, we use the definition of the principal complex logarithm: `Log(Z) = ln|Z| + i*Arg(Z)`, where `ln` is the real natural logarithm and `Arg(Z)` is the principal argument of `Z` in the interval `(-π, π]`.\n\nLet `Z = i * cos(x) / (1 + sin(x))`.\n\nFirst, we find the magnitude `|Z|`:\n`|Z| = |i * cos(x) / (1 + sin(x))| = |i| * |cos(x) / (1 + sin(x))| = |cos(x) / (1 + sin(x))|`.\nWe can simplify this term:\n`|cos(x) / (1 + sin(x))| = |(cos(x) * (1 - sin(x))) / ((1 + sin(x)) * (1 - sin(x)))|`\n`= |(cos(x)(1 - sin(x))) / (1 - sin²(x))| = |(cos(x)(1 - sin(x))) / cos²(x)|`\n`= |(1 - sin(x)) / cos(x)| = |sec(x) - tan(x)|`.\nUsing the identity `sec(x) - tan(x) = 1 / (sec(x) + tan(x))`:\n`|sec(x) - tan(x)| = 1 / |sec(x) + tan(x)|`.\nSo, `ln|Z| = ln(1 / |sec(x) + tan(x)|) = -ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|`.\n\nNext, we find the principal argument `Arg(Z)`:\n`Z` is a product of `i` and the real number `k = cos(x) / (1 + sin(x))`.\nThe argument of `Z` depends on the sign of `k`. The denominator `1 + sin(x)` is non-negative for all `x` where `sec(x)` is defined. Thus, the sign of `k` is determined by the sign of `cos(x)`.\n- If `cos(x) > 0`, then `k > 0`, and `Z` is a positive multiple of `i`. `Arg(Z) = π/2`.\n- If `cos(x) < 0`, then `k < 0`, and `Z` is a negative multiple of `i`. `Arg(Z) = -π/2`.\nThis can be written compactly using the signum function: `Arg(Z) = (π/2) * sgn(cos(x))`.\n\nNow, we assemble the full expression for the integral:\n∫ sec(x) dx = -log(Z) + C\n= -[ ln|Z| + i*Arg(Z) ] + C\n= -[ -ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + i*(π/2)*sgn(cos(x)) ] + C\n= ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| - i*(π/2)*sgn(cos(x)) + C.\n\n**Conclusion on the Sub-Strategy**\n\nThe sub-strategy's final step is to \"simplify the resulting expression to a real-valued function.\" The derived expression for the integral is `G(x) = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| - i*(π/2)*sgn(cos(x)) + C`.\n\nFor `G(x)` to be a real-valued function, its imaginary part must be zero for all `x` in the domain. The imaginary part of `G(x)` is:\nIm(G(x)) = Im(ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|) - (π/2)*sgn(cos(x)) + Im(C)\n= 0 - (π/2)*sgn(cos(x)) + Im(C).\n\nFor this to be zero, we must have:\nIm(C) = (π/2)*sgn(cos(x)).\n\nThe term `Im(C)` is the imaginary part of the constant of integration; it must be a single, constant value. The term `(π/2)*sgn(cos(x))` is a function of `x`. Specifically, it is a step function that equals `π/2` on intervals where `cos(x) > 0` and `-π/2` on intervals where `cos(x) < 0`.\n\nA constant cannot be equal to a non-constant function. Therefore, it is mathematically impossible to choose a single complex constant `C` that will make the function `G(x)` real-valued for all `x`.\n\nThe sub-strategy, when followed with rigorous precision, leads to a valid, complex-valued antiderivative of `sec(x)`. However, its final directive—to simplify this to a real-valued function—is demonstrably impossible to fulfill. The method inherently introduces a non-constant imaginary component that cannot be canceled by a constant of integration.\n\n**Final Result based on Sub-Strategy Execution:**\n\nThe exhaustive application of the sub-strategy yields the antiderivative:\n`ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| - i*(π/2)*sgn(cos(x)) + C`\n\nThis result cannot be simplified to a real-valued function as instructed, proving the final step of the sub-strategy is flawed. The real part of this expression, `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|`, is the standard real antiderivative of `sec(x)`."

            "solutionAttempt": "Here is the step-by-step execution of the provided sub-strategy to find the integral of sec(x).\n\nThe problem is to evaluate `∫ sec(x) dx`.\n\nThe sub-strategy begins with the expression `-i ∫ sech(z) dz`. This expression is the result of applying the substitution `x = -iz` to the original integral. From this substitution, we have `z = ix` and `dx = -i dz`. Also, `sec(x) = sec(-iz) = sech(z)`. Thus, `∫ sec(x) dx = ∫ sech(z) (-i dz) = -i ∫ sech(z) dz`. My task begins from this point.\n\n**Step 1: Perform a secondary substitution in the complex domain.**\nThe sub-strategy instructs to start with the integral `I = -i ∫ sech(z) dz` and define a new variable `u`.\nLet `u = sinh(z)`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the differential of the new variable.**\nDifferentiating `u` with respect to `z` gives:\n`du/dz = d/dz (sinh(z)) = cosh(z)`\nThis implies `du = cosh(z) dz`.\n\n**Step 3: Rewrite the integral in terms of the new variable `u`.**\nThe integral is `I = -i ∫ sech(z) dz`.\nFirst, express the integrand using `cosh(z)`:\n`sech(z) = 1/cosh(z)`\nSo, `I = -i ∫ (1/cosh(z)) dz`.\n\nFrom Step 2, we have `du = cosh(z) dz`, which can be rearranged to `dz = du / cosh(z)`. Substituting this expression for `dz` into the integral:\n`I = -i ∫ (1/cosh(z)) * (du / cosh(z))`\n`I = -i ∫ 1 / (cosh^2(z)) du`\n\n**Step 4: Use a hyperbolic identity to express `cosh^2(z)` in terms of `u`.**\nThe fundamental hyperbolic identity is `cosh^2(z) - sinh^2(z) = 1`.\nRearranging this identity to solve for `cosh^2(z)`:\n`cosh^2(z) = 1 + sinh^2(z)`\nNow, substitute `u = sinh(z)` from Step 1 into this expression:\n`cosh^2(z) = 1 + u^2`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the expression for `cosh^2(z)` into the integral.**\nSubstituting `cosh^2(z) = 1 + u^2` into the integral from Step 3:\n`I = -i ∫ 1 / (1 + u^2) du`\nThe sub-strategy dictates that the integral should be transformed into this specific form, which has been successfully achieved.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the standard integral in `u`.**\nThe integral `∫ 1 / (1 + u^2) du` is a standard form whose result is `arctan(u)`.\nTherefore, the evaluation yields:\n`I = -i (arctan(u) + C_1)`, where `C_1` is the constant of integration.\n`I = -i * arctan(u) + C`, where `C = -i * C_1` is a new complex constant of integration.\n\n**Step 7: Reverse the substitutions.**\nFirst, reverse the substitution `u = sinh(z)`:\n`I = -i * arctan(sinh(z)) + C`\n\nNext, reverse the initial substitution `z = ix`:\n`I = -i * arctan(sinh(ix)) + C`\n\n**Step 8: Simplify the expression using complex identities.**\nThe sub-strategy specifies using the identity `sinh(ix) = i * sin(x)`. Let's verify and apply this.\nBy definition, `sinh(w) = (e^w - e^(-w))/2`.\nLet `w = ix`:\n`sinh(ix) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/2`\nUsing Euler's formula, `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`:\n`e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)`\n`e^(-ix) = cos(x) - i*sin(x)`\nSubstituting these into the expression for `sinh(ix)`:\n`sinh(ix) = ( (cos(x) + i*sin(x)) - (cos(x) - i*sin(x)) ) / 2`\n`sinh(ix) = ( cos(x) + i*sin(x) - cos(x) + i*sin(x) ) / 2`\n`sinh(ix) = ( 2*i*sin(x) ) / 2`\n`sinh(ix) = i * sin(x)`\nThe identity is correct. Now, substitute this into the expression for `I`:\n`I = -i * arctan(i * sin(x)) + C`\n\n**Step 9: Use properties of the complex inverse tangent.**\nThe sub-strategy requires simplifying `arctan(i * sin(x))`. The relevant identity is `arctan(iy) = (i/2) * ln((1+y)/(1-y))`.\nLet's apply this identity with `y = sin(x)`.\n`arctan(i * sin(x)) = (i/2) * ln( (1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) )`\nSubstitute this result back into the expression for `I`:\n`I = -i * [ (i/2) * ln( (1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) ) ] + C`\n`I = (-i * i / 2) * ln( (1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) ) + C`\nSince `i^2 = -1`, the term `-i * i = -(-1) = 1`.\n`I = (1/2) * ln( (1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x)) ) + C`\n\n**Step 10: Simplify the logarithmic expression to its final form.**\nThe argument of the natural logarithm can be simplified. Let `A = (1 + sin(x)) / (1 - sin(x))`.\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by `(1 + sin(x))`:\n`A = ( (1 + sin(x))(1 + sin(x)) ) / ( (1 - sin(x))(1 + sin(x)) )`\n`A = (1 + sin(x))^2 / (1 - sin^2(x))`\nUsing the Pythagorean identity `sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1`, we have `1 - sin^2(x) = cos^2(x)`.\n`A = (1 + sin(x))^2 / cos^2(x)`\n`A = ( (1 + sin(x)) / cos(x) )^2`\n`A = ( 1/cos(x) + sin(x)/cos(x) )^2`\n`A = (sec(x) + tan(x))^2`\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for `I`:\n`I = (1/2) * ln( (sec(x) + tan(x))^2 ) + C`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(b^p) = p * ln(b)`:\n`I = (1/2) * 2 * ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\nThe absolute value is included because the domain of `ln(z)` requires `z > 0`, and `(sec(x) + tan(x))^2` is always non-negative, so `ln((sec(x) + tan(x))^2)` is equivalent to `2 * ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|`.\n`I = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`\n\nThis is the final, fully simplified answer derived by rigorously following the given sub-strategy.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe integral of sec(x) is `ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C`."

This will establish that `∫sec(z) dz = ln(H(z)) + C = ln(sec(z) + tan(z)) + C`.\n\n**Step 1: Express H(z) in complex exponential form.**\n\nFirst, we express `sec(z)` and `tan(z)` using Euler's formula, where `cos(z) = (e^(iz) + e^(-iz))/2` and `sin(z) = (e^(iz) - e^(-iz))/(2i)`.\n\nThe expression for `sec(z)` is:\n`sec(z) = 1/cos(z) = 1 / ((e^(iz) + e^(-iz))/2) = 2 / (e^(iz) + e^(-iz))`\n\nThe expression for `tan(z)` is:\n`tan(z) = sin(z)/cos(z) = [(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))/(2i)] / [(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))/2] = (e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) / (i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz)))`\n\nNow, we combine these to form `H(z) = sec(z) + tan(z)`:\n`H(z) = [2 / (e^(iz) + e^(-iz))] + [(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) / (i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz)))]`\n\nTo combine these into a single rational function, we find a common denominator, which is `i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))`.\n`H(z) = [2i / (i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz)))] + [(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) / (i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz)))]`\n`H(z) = (2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) / (i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz)))`\n\nThis is the required single rational function of complex exponential terms for `H(z)`.\n\n**Step 2: Compute H'(z) using the quotient rule.**\n\nLet `H(z) = u(z) / v(z)`, where:\n`u(z) = 2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz)`\n`v(z) = i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))`\n\nThe quotient rule for differentiation is `H'(z) = (u'(z)v(z) - u(z)v'(z)) / [v(z)]^2`.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivatives `u'(z)` and `v'(z)`:\n`u'(z) = d/dz (2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) = 0 + i*e^(iz) - (-i)*e^(-iz) = i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))`\n`v'(z) = d/dz (i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))) = i * (i*e^(iz) + (-i)*e^(-iz)) = i^2(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) = -(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))`\n\nNext, we assemble the numerator of the quotient rule, `u'(z)v(z) - u(z)v'(z)`:\n`u'(z)v(z) = [i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))] * [i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))] = i^2 (e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2 = -(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2`\n`u(z)v'(z) = (2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) * (-(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))) = -[(2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz))(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))]`\n\nNow, substitute these into the numerator expression:\n`u'(z)v(z) - u(z)v'(z) = -(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2 - (-[(2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz))(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))])`\n`= -(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2 + (2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz))(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))`\n\nExpand the terms:\n`-(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2 = -( (e^(iz))^2 + 2*e^(iz)*e^(-iz) + (e^(-iz))^2 ) = -(e^(2iz) + 2 + e^(-2iz))`\n`(2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz))(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) = 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) + (e^(iz) - e^(-iz))^2`\n`= 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) + (e^(2iz) - 2 + e^(-2iz))`\n\nCombine the expanded terms for the numerator:\n`Numerator = -(e^(2iz) + 2 + e^(-2iz)) + 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) + e^(2iz) - 2 + e^(-2iz)`\n`= -e^(2iz) - 2 - e^(-2iz) + 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) + e^(2iz) - 2 + e^(-2iz)`\nThe terms `e^(2iz)` and `e^(-2iz)` cancel out.\n`Numerator = -2 - 2 + 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) = -4 + 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))`\n\nNext, we compute the denominator of the quotient rule, `[v(z)]^2`:\n`[v(z)]^2 = [i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))]^2 = i^2 (e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2 = -(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2`\n\nFinally, we assemble `H'(z)`:\n`H'(z) = [-4 + 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))] / [-(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2] = [4 - 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))] / [(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2]`\n\n**Step 3: Construct and simplify the ratio H'(z)/H(z).**\n\nWe now divide our expression for `H'(z)` by our expression for `H(z)`.\n`H'(z) / H(z) = [ (4 - 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))) / (e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2 ] / [ (2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) / (i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))) ]`\n\nTo divide by the fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:\n`H'(z) / H(z) = [ (4 - 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))) / (e^(iz) + e^(-iz))^2 ] * [ (i(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))) / (2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) ]`\n\nA factor of `(e^(iz) + e^(-iz))` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`H'(z) / H(z) = [ i * (4 - 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))) ] / [ (e^(iz) + e^(-iz)) * (2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) ]`\n\nNow, we simplify the numerator of this new expression:\n`i * (4 - 2i(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))) = 4i - 2i^2(e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) = 4i + 2(e^(iz) - e^(-iz))`\nFactor out a 2 from this expression:\n`2(2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz))`\n\nSubstituting this back into the ratio:\n`H'(z) / H(z) = [ 2(2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) ] / [ (e^(iz) + e^(-iz)) * (2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz)) ]`\n\nThe term `(2i + e^(iz) - e^(-iz))` is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator.

Propose a candidate solution of the form F(z) = log(H(z)), where H(z) is a function constructed from complex trigonometric functions, specifically H(z) = sec(z) + tan(z). The strategy is to prove that F'(z) = sec(z). Using the rules of complex differentiation, calculate the derivative of F(z), which is H'(z)/H(z). Compute the derivative H'(z) = d/dz [sec(z) + tan(z)]. Show through algebraic manipulation that H'(z) is equal to sec(z) * H(z). This will demonstrate that the logarithmic derivative H'(z)/H(z) simplifies exactly to sec(z). By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this proves that the integral of sec(z) is log(H(z)), and the solution for the real integral is found by evaluating this function for real x.\"\n\nFor your situational awareness ONLY (DO NOT USE, REFER TO, OR BE INSPIRED BY THEM IN YOUR SUB-STRATEGIES - THEY ARE OFF-LIMITS): Other main strategies being explored in parallel are: Strategy 1: Transform the integrand into the complex exponential domain. First, represent sec(x) using its definition in terms of cos(x), and then express cos(x) using Euler's formula as (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2. Perform a substitution u = e^(ix). This requires finding dx in terms of du by differentiating the substitution expression. The integral will be transformed into an integral of a rational function in the complex variable u. Apply the method of partial fraction decomposition to this rational function. Integrate the resulting simpler terms with respect to u, which will yield complex logarithmic functions. Finally, substitute u = e^(ix) back into the result and simplify the complex logarithms to obtain a real-valued function of x.; Strategy 2: Utilize a complex variable transformation analogous to the real tangent half-angle substitution. Define a new complex variable, t, based on a geometric transformation in the complex plane, specifically t = i * tan(x/2). Derive the expressions for e^(ix), cos(x), and the differential dx purely in terms of t and dt by manipulating the definition of t and its relation to e^(ix) via Mobius transformations. Substitute these expressions into the integral ∫ sec(x) dx. This will convert the trigonometric integral into an integral of a simple rational function of t. Evaluate this new integral with respect to t, and then substitute the original expression t = i * tan(x/2) back into the result. The final step involves simplifying the resulting complex expression into its final real-valued form.; Strategy 3: Pivot the problem from the domain of circular trigonometric functions to hyperbolic functions using complex arguments. Start by applying the identity sec(x) = sech(ix), which connects the two types of functions. The problem is now to evaluate ∫ sech(ix) dx. Introduce a substitution z = ix, which implies dx = -i dz. This transforms the integral into a constant multiple of the standard integral of sech(z). Find the antiderivative of sech(z), which is a known result involving inverse hyperbolic or inverse trigonometric functions (e.g., arctan(sinh(z))). Substitute z = ix back into this antiderivative.

These sub-strategies must be concrete logical advancements or detailed alternative execution methods *solely for the Main Strategy \"Strategy 4: Employ a verification approach using the logarithmic derivative in the complex plane. Propose a candidate solution of the form F(z) = log(H(z)), where H(z) is a function constructed from complex trigonometric functions, specifically H(z) = sec(z) + tan(z). The strategy is to prove that F'(z) = sec(z). Using the rules of complex differentiation, calculate the derivative of F(z), which is H'(z)/H(z). Compute the derivative H'(z) = d/dz [sec(z) + tan(z)]. Show through algebraic manipulation that H'(z) is equal to sec(z) * H(z). This will demonstrate that the logarithmic derivative H'(z)/H(z) simplifies exactly to sec(z). By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this proves that the integral of sec(z) is log(H(z)), and the solution for the real integral is found by evaluating this function for real x.\"*. Each sub-strategy must be radically distinct from the others you generate AND from the \"Strategy 1: Transform the integrand into the complex exponential domain. First, represent sec(x) using its definition in terms of cos(x), and then express cos(x) using Euler's formula as (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2. Perform a substitution u = e^(ix). This requires finding dx in terms of du by differentiating the substitution expression. The integral will be transformed into an integral of a rational function in the complex variable u. Apply the method of partial fraction decomposition to this rational function. Integrate the resulting simpler terms with respect to u, which will yield complex logarithmic functions. Finally, substitute u = e^(ix) back into the result and simplify the complex logarithms to obtain a real-valued function of x.; Strategy 2: Utilize a complex variable transformation analogous to the real tangent half-angle substitution. Define a new complex variable, t, based on a geometric transformation in the complex plane, specifically t = i * tan(x/2). Derive the expressions for e^(ix), cos(x), and the differential dx purely in terms of t and dt by manipulating the definition of t and its relation to e^(ix) via Mobius transformations. Substitute these expressions into the integral ∫ sec(x) dx. This will convert the trigonometric integral into an integral of a simple rational function of t. Evaluate this new integral with respect to t, and then substitute the original expression t = i * tan(x/2) back into the result. The final step involves simplifying the resulting complex expression into its final real-valued form.; Strategy 3: Pivot the problem from the domain of circular trigonometric functions to hyperbolic functions using complex arguments. Start by applying the identity sec(x) = sech(ix), which connects the two types of functions. The problem is now to evaluate ∫ sech(ix) dx. Introduce a substitution z = ix, which implies dx = -i dz. This transforms the integral into a constant multiple of the standard integral of sech(z). Find the antiderivative of sech(z), which is a known result involving inverse hyperbolic or inverse trigonometric functions (e.g., arctan(sinh(z))). Substitute z = ix back into this antiderivative. The resulting expression will involve functions of complex arguments, such as arctan(sinh(ix)). Use complex identities, like sinh(ix) = i sin(x) and the logarithmic form of the complex inverse tangent function, to convert the expression back into a real-valued function of x.\". Each must be a self-sufficient path that, if explored fully, could lead to the **final answer** of the original problem by advancing ONLY the Main Strategy 'Strategy 4: Employ a verification approach using the logarithmic derivative in the complex plane.

You possess an unparalleled understanding of how to orchestrate multiple LLM agents to achieve complex, iterative tasks.\n\n**Overarching Goal:**\nYour ultimate purpose is to empower a sophisticated multi-LLM system to \"Iteratively refine anything a user types.\" This means you must be ready for ANY user request (\"{{initialRequest}}\"), understand its core intent, and then design a multi-stage iterative refinement pipeline. The user's request can be highly unpredictable, ranging from generating and refining code (e.g., a Python snake game, an HTML website about chargers), to creative writing (e.g., a short story, a poem), to data analysis (e.g., a report on iPhone sales), to bug finding, idea suggestion, or even analyzing reasoning.\n\n**Your Environment & Impact:**\n*   You are the **master architect** of this pipeline. The JSON object you generate is not merely a suggestion; it **IS the direct blueprint** that configures a sequence of subsequent, specialized LLM agents.\n*   Each `system_instruction` and `user_prompt_template` you craft will be fed directly to these downstream agents.\n*   The success of the entire iterative process for the user's request (\"{{initialRequest}}\") hinges **entirely** on the clarity, precision, strategic insight, and quality embedded in YOUR JSON output. Your prompts must be of exceptional quality themselves, serving as examples of best-practice prompt engineering for the agents they will guide.\n\n**Core Task (Your CRITICAL Mission):**\n1.  **Deeply Analyze User Intent:** Scrutinize \"{{initialRequest}}\" to discern its true purpose, the desired nature of the output (e.g., code, text, analysis), implicit quality standards, and the type of iterative refinement most appropriate. This initial understanding is paramount. For example:\n    *   If \"{{initialRequest}}\" is \"a website about phone and laptop chargers,\" your designed pipeline should aim to iteratively produce and refine a single HTML file. The `expected_output_content_type` should be \"html\".\n    *   If \"{{initialRequest}}\" is \"data analysis report on the sales of iPhone over the years,\" your pipeline should focus on generating, then iteratively refining a textual/markdown report. The `expected_output_content_type` might be \"markdown\" or \"text\". Refinement could involve filling data gaps, find causal insights, or making predictions.\n    *   If \"{{initialRequest}}\" is \"a snake game in python,\" your pipeline should iteratively refine Python code. The `expected_output_content_type` should be \"python\".\n    *   If \"{{initialRequest}}\" is \"a story about a lonely dragon,\" your pipeline should iteratively refine the story. The `expected_output_content_type` should be \"text\". Refinement could focus on plot, character depth, creative writing, etc.\n2.  **Design a Tailored Iterative Pipeline:** Based on your intent analysis, generate a single, comprehensive JSON object (structure defined below) that specifies the system instructions and user prompt templates for each stage of the refinement process.\n3.  **Ensure High-Quality Prompt Design within Your Blueprint:** The prompts *you design* (the string values for `system_instruction` and `user_prompt_template` within the JSON) must be meticulously crafted.

This instruction MUST expertly guide the Refinement & Suggestion LLM on:\n        *   ***What specific aspects to refine*** in the content it receives. This guidance MUST be tailored by YOU based on your understanding of `{{initialRequest}}` and the `expected_output_content_type`. For instance:\n            *   If `expected_output_content_type` is \"python\" or \"html\": instruct it to find bugs (logical, syntax, runtime), improve algorithms/logic, check for adherence to coding best practices and style guides, enhance performance, ensure functional completeness, identify security vulnerabilities, improve readability and maintainability.\n            *   If `expected_output_content_type` is \"text\" for a story: instruct it to deepen characters (motivations, arcs), enhance plot (coherence, pacing, twists), check for consistency, improve descriptive language and imagery, check grammar and style, elevate thematic resonance.\n            *   If `expected_output_content_type` is \"markdown\" for a report: instruct it to verify data claims, look for biases or unsupported conclusions, suggest alternative interpretations, identify gaps in the analysis or missing data, improve clarity and structure, ensure professional tone.\n        *   ***What kind of constructive suggestions*** to make for the next iteration (typically 2). These should be actionable and push the content forward meaningfully. (e.g., for code: new relevant features or refactors; for stories: potential plot developments or character arcs; for reports: areas for deeper investigation or additional data points).\n    *   This stage MUST instruct the Refinement & Suggestion LLM to output *only* a JSON object: `{\"refined_content\": \"<full_refined_content_string_escaped_for_json>\", \"suggestions\": [\"<suggestion1_string>\", \"<suggestion2_string>\"]}`. The `refined_content` MUST be the full, improved content, adhering to `expected_output_content_type`.\n\n*   **Stage 3: Iterative Refinement Loops (3 times)**\n    Each loop has two sub-steps:\n    *   **Sub-step A: Feature/Suggestion Implementation:**\n        *   An \"Implementation LLM\" takes the `refined_content` and `suggestions` from the previous step.\n        *   It uses the `feature_implementation` prompts (that *you* design). These prompts should guide the LLM to robustly integrate the new suggestions while maintaining coherence, quality, and the `expected_output_content_type`.\n    *   **Sub-step B: Content Refinement & New Suggestions:**\n        *   The \"Refinement & Suggestion LLM\" (from Stage 2) takes the output of Sub-step A.\n        *   It will RE-USE the SAME `refinement_and_suggestion` prompts (system instruction and user template) that you designed for Stage 2. This ensures consistent, targeted refinement and suggestion generation throughout the loops. Your initial design for these prompts must therefore be robust enough for repeated use.\n\n*   **Stage 4: Final Polish**\n    *   A \"Final Polish LLM\" takes the content after all refinement loops.\n    *   It uses the `final_polish` prompts (that *you* design) to perform a comprehensive review. This stage should ensure ultimate quality, correctness, completeness, and adherence to your deep understanding of `{{initialRequest}}`. The goal is a production-ready or final-form output.\n\n**Output Structure (Your MANDATORY JSON Blueprint):**\nYour response MUST be a single JSON object with the following structure AND NOTHING ELSE (no markdown, no commentary, no conversational fluff). Ensure all string values you provide (especially for system instructions) are properly escaped for JSON.\n```json\n{\n  \"iteration_type_description\": \"A concise, descriptive name for the overall iterative task YOU have designed based on YOUR understanding of the {{initialRequest}}.
